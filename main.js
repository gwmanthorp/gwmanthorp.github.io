40% obedience level\n        Touch proximity condition - 30% obedience level\n        Absent experimenter condition, giving commands over telephone - 21% obedience level\n        <b><u>Location:</u></b>\n        Original studies conducted at Yale University, when study transported to rundown office building, dropped to 48%, lack of credibility\n        <b><u>Uniform:</u></b> Bushman, female researcher asked people on street to give change to male researcher for expired parking meter, if in 'police-style' uniform, 72% obedience, dressed as beggar, 52%, dressed as business woman, 48%",     "<b><u>Agentic state and legitimacy of authority:</u></b>\n        Agentic state is where someone sees themselves as carrying out another persons wishes and feels no guilt or responsibility for actions since they wouldn't have done them if not obeying someone, autonomous state is original and agentic shift takes place\n        One explanation for why people adopt an agentic state is so that they can maintain a positive self image after committing 'evil' acts, the action no longer reflects their self image\n        Perceived legitimate authority define the situation, legitimate authority must have an institution (experimentor at a university in Milgrams study, run down office building is still a _scientific laboratory_ which explains why people still obeyed in this condition",     "<b><u>The Authoritarian Personality:</u></b>\n        Dispositional factor in obedience, explains why some people require little pressure in order to obey, F-scale used by Adorno to measure different components that made up Authoritarian Personality, tended to have strict parenting when they were a child (physical punishment)\n        Altemeyer, Right-wing authoritarianism, three personality traits: Conventionalism - conventional norms and values adherence, Authoritarian Aggression - aggression towards those who violate these norms, Authoritarian Submission - submission to legitimate authorities\n        <b>Elms and Milgram:</b>\n        Aim: To test if authoritarian personality has a link with obedience\n        Method: Got the 40 ppts who did Milgrams original study back and separated them into 20 'obedient' and 20 'defiant' ppts, gave them the F-scale  and MMPI\n        Results: found little difference on MMPI, however, high levels of authoritarianism in those classified as 'obedient', they also reported being less close with their fathers during childhood, obedient ppts saw the authority figure in the study as more admirable",     "<b><u>Resistance to social influence:</u></b>\n        <b>Social Support:</b>\n        <u>For resisting conformity</u> - Asch, when unanimous majority broken and confederate agreed with ppt (social support) conformity dropped from 33% to 5.5%, through breaking the unanimity, raises possibilty that there are other legitimate ways of thinking that can be considered\n        <u>For resisting obedience</u> - Disobedient peers act as role models for individuals to base their own behaviour off of, in one of Milgrams variations ppt was in group of 3 teachers (other 2 were confeds), the conferederates one after the other defied the authority figure, only 10% reached 450 volts\n        <b>Locus of control:</b>\n        <u>High <b>internal</b> locus of control</u> - more likely to disobey authority figures since they don't require others to tell them what to do and believe everything that happens to them is their own doing, active seekers of correct information so they dont rely on others to form opinions,  more likely to lead others\n        <u>High <b>external</b> locus of control</u> - more likely to obey authority figures since they are more passive and fatalistic (belive everything is destined and they have little to no control), hence they are more likely to rely on others and less likely to display independent behaviour",     "<b><u>Minority Influence:</u></b>\n        <b>3 features of minority influence</b>\n        <u>Consistent</u> - when people first exposed they assume minority is in the wrong, if minority are consistent and keep on expressing their opinion, people are more likely to re-evaluate their argument\n        <u>Commitment</u> - the minority show that they are willing to suffer for their cause, facing hostile majority, this is more likely to persuade majority since they question why minority so commited\n        <u>Flexibility</u> - it is also important that the minority are willing to adjust their argument slightly to fit both their needs and the needs of the majority, the ability to essentially compromise to where both parties are happy, majority will more likely accept these terms\n        <b>Moscovici:</b>\n        Aim: To test the importance of consistency in a minority position\n        Method: 4ppts and 2 confederates in each group, shown a series of blue slides that varied only in intensity, consistent condition - confederates said green for every slide, inconsistent condition - said green on 2/3 of trials, control with all ppts\n        Results: in control group they said blue every time, inconsistent condition - ppts said green 2% of trials, consistent condition - ppts said green 8% of trials",     "<b><u>Social influence processes in social change:</u></b>\n        <b>Social change through minority influence</b>\n        1) Drawing attention to an issue - educating majority, raising awareness\n        2) Cognitive conflict - majority thinking more deeply about the issue raised by minority\n        3) Consistency to position - consistent protests and not giving up, persistence\n        4) Augmentation principle - show majority that you are willing to suffer for your cause\n        5) Snowball effect - once some of the majority start to follow the minority this group slowly grows larger and larger spreading until it reaches a tipping point at which point it brings about wide spread change\n        <b>Social change through majority influence</b>\n        Social norms interventions - starts by identifying a widespread misperception, e.g. young people tend to misperceive the frequency and quantity of alcohol drunk by their peers and as such develop larger drinking habbits, correction campaigns are put in place to correct the misperception and communicating the _actual_ norm\n        <b>Example: 'Most of Us don't drink and drive</b>\n        Designed to reduce drink driving habbits among young adults in Montana, inital survey found that whilst 20.4% of young adults reported having driven within one hour of consuming two or more drinks in the previous month in Montana, 92% of respondants believed that the majority of their peers had done so, by simply correcting this misperception, the following month the drink driving was reduced to 13.7%"]
