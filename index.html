In terms of attachment this uconditioned stimulus (UCS) is food which produce the unconditioned response (UCR) of pleasure. The mother is the neutral stimulus (NS) since she is present when the infant is being fed but currently has no association to the food in the infants eyes. Over time any NS will take on the properties of the UCS and produce the same response, so the NS now becomes a conditioned stimulus (CS) and produces a conditioned response (CR). Learning theorists called this newly formed stimulus-response 'motherly love'\n<b>Operant Conditioning</b>\nFirst researched by Skinner, offers an explanation for attachment based on operant conditioning and drive reduction theory. When the infant is hungry, there is a 'drive' to reduce the accompanying discomfort. When the infant is fed, this produces a feeling of pleasure, this is negative reinforcement. The behaviour that led to food is repeated when hungry again since it was rewarding. Food becomes primary reinforcer since it supplies the reward. Through classical conditioning the person who supplies the food is associated with the reward and hence becomes a secondary reinforcer, leads to attachment as child seeks person who can provide the reward\n<b>Social learning theory</b>\nFirst researched by Bandura, its suggested that modelling could be used to explain attachment behaviour, imitates parents affectionate behaviour, parents also directly instruct their children on how to act in relationships and reward appropriate attachment behaviours such as hugging","<b><u>Explanations of attachment: Bowlbys Theory</u></b>\n<b>ASCMI</b>\n<b>Adaptive:</b> attachments is evolutionary, used to keep us safe as infants\n<b>Social Releasers:</b> acts such as smiling and crying that mean that parents want to care for them, explains how attachments are formed\n<b>Critical Period:</b> attachments must form between 3-6 months, if no attachment formed in this period then infants will have difficulty forming attachments in later life, Bowlby proposed attachment are formed by sensitivity\n<b>Monotropy:</b> Bowlby proposed that infants have one special emotional bond, often mother, also important for secondary attachments to be formed for social and psychological development\n<b>Internal Working Model:</b> The consequences of attachment, 1) gives the child insight into caregivers behaviour and allows them to influence the caregivers behaviour to form true partnership, 2) acts as template for all future relationships to be based on", "<b><u>Ainsworths Strange Situation</u></b>\n<b>Method:</b> eight episodes to measure the behaviours of: <li>separation anxiety</li><li>reunion behaviour</li><li>stranger anxiety</li><li>parents as a secure base</li>Data collected by observers behind a one way mirror, ranked each of desired behaviours on scale\n<b>Results:</b>106 total infants, similar behaviours were exploratory behaviours reducing past epiode 2 and crying increasing\n<li><b>Secure attachment - type B:</b> 66% of infants - harmonious interactions with their caregiver, not likely to cry if caregiver leave, easily soothed by bodily contact with caregiver, showed some stranger anxiety, ued caregiver as secure base effectively and allowed for independent exploratory behaviour</li><li><b>Insecure-avoidant - type A:</b> 22% - children who tended to avoid social interaction and intimacy, showed little response to separation and didnt seek proximity of caregiver on reunion, not clingy, able to explore without presence of caregiver</li><li><b>Insecure-resistant - type C:</b> 12% - both seeks and resists intimacy, distressed when separated with caregiver, high stranger anxiety, conflicting behaviours with reunion behaviour, may angrily resist being picked up whilst maintaining close proximity</li>","<b><u>Cultural variations in attachment</b></u>\n<b>Van IJzendoorn and Kroonenberg</b>\n<b>Aim:</b> To see if there was evidence that inter-cultural differences did exist, also intra-cultural differences\n<b>Method:</b> meta-analysis from 32 studies, overall looked at over 2000 Strange Situation classifications in 8 countries\n<b>Results:</b> <u>Secure</u> was most common across all countries, highest being in Great Britain. <u>Insecure-avoidant</u> was the next most common across all countries except Israel and Japan both collectivist cultures who had <u>insecure-resistant</u> as their top attachment type\nThese cultural similarities support the view that attachments are an innate and biological process, also since secure attachments were the 'norm' supports idea that this attachment type is 'best' for healthy development\n<b>Found that variation within cultures was 1.5 times larger than variation across cultures</b>\n<img src='images/one.png' width='400px'>\n<b><u>Cultural Similarities</u></b>\nTronick studied an African tribe, the Efe.

Hypervigilance.","<b><u>The behavioural approach to explaining phobias</u></b>\n<b>Mowrer</b> proposed the <b>two-process model</b> made up of the following stages:\n<b><u>Classical conditioning: initiation</u></b>\nPhobia is acquired through association between NS and UCS. Little Albert was a real example of this. UCS was a loud sound that created the UCR of fear. By pairing the loud sound with a white furry animal NS, over time Little Albert drew a connection between white furry animals and a fear response. This is now a CS whereby fear is associated with white furry animals - a phobia. This same process can be applied to other phobias as well.\n<b><u>Operant Conditioning: maintenance</u></b>\nClassical conditioning leads to the acquisition of a phobia, however, this does not explain why the fear is maintained or why individuals avoid the feared thing. Operant conditioning explains this. By avoiding the stimulus, the fear response is reduced and hence is a form of negative reinforcement. As such, the individual coninues avoiding said stimulus so that they dont feel as much fear.\n<b><u>Social Learning</u></b>\nPhobias may be acquired through modelling the behaviour of others e.g. if a child sees their parent have a strong fear response to spiders then they are more likely to exhibit this same fear response","<b><u>The behavioural approach to treating phobias</u></b>\n<b><u>Flooding</u></b>\nThe person with the phobia is immediately exposed to the worst possible case of their phobia in one long session. The session continues until the patient's anxiety has disappeared. The patient is taught relaxation techniques to the exposure.\n<u>Rationale:</u> A person's fear response (due to adrenaline) has a time limit. As the levels of adrenaline naturally decrease, the patient learns a new association - linking the stimulus to a non-anxious response.\n<b><u>Systematic Desensitisation</u></b>\n<Wolpe</b> developed this technique, whereby phobics were introduced to the feared stimulus gradually.\n<b>Counterconditioning</b>\nThe patient is taught a new association that is <i>counter</i> to the original association. Taught to learn a new association that links the phobic stimulus to a reduced anxiety or relaxation of sorts.\n<b>Relaxation</b>To start of the process of systematic desensitisation, the therapist will firstly teach the patient different relaxation strategies. This can be things such as slow breathing (breathing techniques) or visualisation (imagining a peacful scene).\n<b>Desensitisation Hierarchy</b>\nGradually introducing the feared situation one step at a time, so its not so overwhelming. The stages are outlined below:<ol><li>Patient taught relaxation</li><li>Therapist and patient create a desensitisation hierarchy, each scene causing a little more fear than the last</li><li>Patient gradually works way through hierarchy</li><li>Once patient has mastered one step, move onto next</li><li>Patient successfully masters the feared situation</li></ol>","<b><u>The cognitive approach to explaining depression</u></b>\n<b><u>Ellis' ABC Model</u></b>\nEllis proposed that the key to mental disorders such as depression is with irrational thoughts. His ABC model is as follows:<li><b>A</b> - activating event</li><li><b>B</b> - belief, may be rational or irrational</li><li><b>C</b> - consequence, rational beliefs lead to healthy emotions, irrational leads to unhealthy emotions.</li><b>Musturbatory</b>\nSource irrational beliefs lies in musturbatory thinking, thinking certain ideas must be true in order for an individual to be happy. Ellis identified the 3 most important irrational beliefs:<li>I <i>must</i> be approved of or accepted by people I find important</li><li>I <i>must</i> do well, or I am worthless</li><li>The world <i>must</i> give me happiness, or I will die</li>An individual who holds these beliefs is likely to be at least, disappointed or at worst, depressed. These 'musts' need to be challenged for mental wellness.\n<b><u>Beck's Negative Triad</u></b>\Beck believed that depressed individuals deel as they do because their thinking is negative and they lack a perceived sense of control.\n<b>Negative Schema</b>\nDepressed people have acquired a negative schema during childhood, may be due to a number of factors e.g. parental and/or peer rejection and criticims. When an indivdual with these schemas encounters a new situation that aligns with their schema, they perceive this situation in a negative light. Leads to over generalisations and cognitive biases.\n<b>The negative triad</b>\n<img src='images/three.png'>","<b><u>The cognitive approach to treating depression</u></b>\n<b><u>Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)</u></b>\nEllis, one of first psychologists to develop a form of CBT. Called it <i>rational therapy</i> whereby the aim was to turn irrational thoughts into rational ones. Then renamed to RET and then REBT (rational emotional behavioural therapy) as he tried to correct all of these things.\n<b>Challenging irrational thoughts</b>\nEllis extended his ABC model to include DEF as treatment for the originally identified issues:<li><b>D</b> - Disputing irrational thoughts and beliefs</li><li><b>E</b> - Effects of disputing and Effective attitude to life</li><li><b>F</b> - Feelings that are produced</li>REBT focuses on disputing irrational beliefs and consists of:<li>Logical disputing - 'Does this make sense?'</li><li>Empirical disputing - 'Where is the proof?'</li><li>Pragmatic disputing - 'Is this way of thinking beneficial to me?'(it aint)\n<b>Homework</b>\nThe therapist will ask the client to go out and complete a piece of 'homework' between sessions. This may be things that they would not typically do e.g. asking someone out on a date when they were previously scared of rejection. This is crucial for testing irrational thoughts against reality, turning them into rational ones\n<b>Behavioural activation</b>\nThis involves things such as completing excercise and engaging in pleasurable activities. Based on basic concept that being active leads to rewards that act as an antidote to depression.\n<b>Unconditional positive regard</b>\nThis is an important feature of CBT that involves the therapist being positive to the client and reminding them of their worth as a human. If they feel worthless they are less likely to engage with sessions and less likely to change for the better. If the therapist provides respect and appreciation no matter what, it will faciliate a change in behaviours and attitudes within the client.","<b><u>The biological approach to explaining OCD</u></b>\n<b><u>Genetic Explanations</u></b>\n<b>The COMT gene</b>\nCOMT regulates the production of the <b>neurotransmitter dopamine</b>. One <u>variation</u> of the COMT gene has been found more frequently in people with OCD than those without it. This variation leads to lower COMT gene activity and higher levels of dopamine\n<b>The SERT gene</b>\nThis gene affects the transport of serotonin. Lower levels are a result and lower levels of serotonin are linked with the OCD disorder.\n<b>Diathesis-stress</b>\nThe suggestion is that each of these genes creates a vulnerability (diathesis) for OCD and that the a certain mental disorder is triggered by events experienced by the individual (stress) which is why they appear as different disorders, depression for example shares the same genes as OCD\n<b><u>Neural Explanations</u></b>\n<b>Abnormal levels of neurotransmitters</b>\nIts thought that <b>dopamine levels are abnormally high in OCD patients</b>. Based on animal studies, high dose of drugs enhancing dopamine levels induced behaviours resembling the compulsive behaviours found in OCD patients. Also <b>lower levels of serotonin</b> are associated with OCD. This is because antidepressants that increase serotonin have been shown to reduce OCD symptoms whereas antidepressants that have less effect on serotonin do not reduce OCD symptoms.\n<b>Abnormal brain circuits</b>\nCertain areas in the frontal lobes of the brain are thought to be abnormal for OCD patients. The <b>caudate nucleus</b> normally supresses signals from the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The OFC sends signals to the thalamus about things that are worrying, such as a potential germ hazard. When the caudate nucleus is damaged, it doesn't suppress minor 'worry' signals and the thalamus is alerted regardless, sending signal back to OFC, as a worry circuit. Dopamine and serotonin are also linked to the OFC and caudate nucleus.","<b><u>The biological approach to treating OCD</u></b>\n<b><u>Antidepressants: SSRIs</u></b>\nUsed to reduce anxiety that comes with OCD. Antidepressents can be used to increase serotonin which links with the 'worry circuit' to try to normalise the circuit. SSRIs increase levels of serotonin, regulating mood and anxiety. Works by inhibiting the re-uptake of serotonin (Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors) so that there is more available in the synapse.\n<b><u>Antidepressants: Tricyclics</u></b>\nBlocks the transporter mechanism that re-absorbs both serotonin and noradrenaline. As a result more of these ntrans are left in the synapse for easing transmission during next impulse. They have advantage of targeting more than one ntran however they have greater side effects so used only when SSRIs are not effective.\n<b><u>Anti-anxiety drugs</u></b>\nBenzodiazepines commonly used to reduce anxiety. They slow down the activity of the CNS by enhancing ntran called GABA which has a general quietening effect on the neurons on the brain. Allows for chloride ions into neuron which makes it harder for other ntrans to stimulate the neuron hence a calm effect.\n<b><u>Other drugs</u></b>\nD-Cycloserine also appears to enhance GABA and results in similar calming effect, used particularly in conjunction with psychotherapy."],

It therefore enables the brain to regulate bodily processes. Also contains reflex arc so that certain reflexes can be made without direct involvement of the brain\n<b>The brain</b>\nHas 4 main areas - cerebrum, cerebellum, diencephalon and brain stem\n<b>Cerebrum</b>\nThe largest part of the brain that can be broken down into 4 lobes:<li>Occipital lobe - for visual processing</li><li>Temporal lobe - for auditory processing and memory</li><li>Frontal lobe - thought, speech and learning</li><li>Parietal lobe - recieving sensory information</li>The cerebrum is split down the middle into two hemispheres that are connected via the corpus callosum\n<b>Cerebellum</b>\nLocated at the back of the brain and is involved in controlling a persons motor skills and balance\n<b>Diencephalon</b>\nConsists of the thalamus - recieves nerve impulses from the body and relays them to correct brain area to be processes, and hypthalamus - acts as a link for the endocrine system, regulates numerous bodily processes\n<b>Brain stem</b>\nAlso responsible for regulating automatic functions such as breathing, heartbeat and swallowing\n\n<b><u>The peripheral nervous system</u></b>\nAll nerves outside of the CNS, they relay information to the CNS\n<b>The somatic nervous system</b>\nMade up of sensory neurons and motor neurons, takes part in reflex actions\n<b>The autonomic</b>\nInvoluntary actions that you are not conciously aware of, heartbeat and digestion. Comprised of two branches:\n<b>Sympathetic nervous system</b> - fight or flight system, increasing heart rate, and blood pressure. Dilating blood vessels and pupils, unecessary processes slowed - digestion.\n<b>The parasympathetic nervous system</b> - relaxes an individual following an emergency, slows heartbeat and reduces blood pressure, rest and digest","<b><u>Neurons and synaptic transmission</u></b>\n<b>Sensory neurons</b>\nCarry nerve impulses from receptors to the spinal cord. Sensory receptors found in various places throughout the body, eyes, skin. Not all travel to brain, some terminate at the spinal cord for reflex arc.\n<b>Relay neurons</b>\nAllows for sensory and motor neurons to communicate with each other. Lie wholly in the brain and spinal cord\n<b>Motor neurons</b>\nCarry signals from the CNS to the effectors\n<img src='images/eleven.png'>\n\n<b>Synaptic Transmission</b><ol><li>Electrical impulse reaches the</li><li>axon terminal where it stimulates the release of</li><li>neurotransmitters from the</li><li>vesicles (exocytosis).

Alertness, phyiological arousal, stimulation, agitation, paranoia\n<b>Inhibitory neurotransmitters</b>\nSerotonin, decreases likelihood of neuron firing + subsequent neurons firing as a result, calms brain by lowering response to excitatory n/trans\n<b>Summation</b>\nWhen the brain is recieving both inhibitory and excitatory n/trans it needs to evaulate which one to prioritise. It does this by summation where whatever n/trans the neuron is currently recieving more of dictates whether it fires or not.","<b><u>The endocrine system</u></b>\n<b>Endocrine glands and hormones</b>\nProduce and secrete hormones, chemicals that circulate in the bloodstream which regulate the activity of organs and tissues in the body, only tend to target specific cells. Major glands are pituitary, adrenal and reproducted organs. Hypothalamus receives certain signals which then alerts glands to secrete hormones to counteract these changes and return to a base level. Then the hypothalamus stops sending signals out to glands and so hormones are no longer secreted.\n\n<b>Pituitary gland</b>\nIts primary function is to produce hormones which influence the release of other hormones from other glands, therefore regulating many bodily functions. It is controlled by the hypothalamu which receives information externally and then uses this to help regulate certain functions. If hormones reach too high a level in the bloodstream, the hypothalamus and pituitary will stop secreting theirs which prevents them getting excessively high, negative feedback. The pituitary gland is broken up into:<p style='margin-left:50px;'><b>Anterior pituitary</b>\nThis part releases cortisol in response to high stress levels and also releases LH and FSH which are important for reproduction.\n\n<b>Posterior pituitary</b>\nThis part releases oxytocin, stimulates the contraction of the uterus during childbirth</p><b>Adrenal glands</b>\nMade up of <b>the adrenal cortex</b> (exterior) which produces cortisol, supports cardiovascular and anti-inflammatory bodily functions. Enables individual to deal with stress. Also contains <b>the adrenal medulla</b> which releases adrenaline - increase heart rate, increased blood flow to the brain, expands air passage to lungs, dilates pupils, slows digestions, and noradrenaline - constricts blood vessels for high blood pressure","<b><u>The fight or flight response</u></b>\n<b>Amygdala and hypothalamus</b>\nThe amygdala associates percieved senses with emotions e.g. what we see leads to fear. If a stressor is detected, the amygdala sends a distress signal to the hypothalamus which activates the sympathetic nervous system. Two main stressor types:\n\n<b>Acute (sudden) stressors</b>\nSympathetic nervous system sends signal to adrenal medulla to release adrenaline and noradrenaline into the bloodstream. This adrenaline results in a number of physiological changes such as heart rate increase, expanding airways, dilated pupils, slowing digestion. Noradrenaline deals with constricting blood vessels for increased blood pressure. Then, following the threat, parasympathetic nervous system is activated which calms down the stress response, slowing heart rate and reducing blood pressure. Restarts digestion (rest and digest).\n\n<b>Chronic (ongoing) stressors</b>\nLeads to HPA axis.<li>Hypothalamus - activates hormonal signals, releasing CRH, to keep SNS working due to continued threat</li><li>Pituitary gland - hormones released by hypothalamus (CRH) result in pituitary gland targeting certain hormones (ACTH) to the adrenal glands</li><li>Adrenal glands - as a result of receiving ACTH from the pituitary gland, the adrenal glands release cortisol for energy and lower pain sensitivity","<b><u>Localisation of function</u></b>\n\n<b><u>Motor and somatosensory</u></b>\n<b>The motor cortex</b>\nFor the generation of voluntary motor movements, located in frontal lobe, both hemispheres of the brain have a motor cortex, controlling muscles on opposite sides of body (controlateral control), certain parts control certain body parts, layed out logically (foot next to leg)\n<b>The somatosensory cortex</b>\nDetects sensory events arising from different parts of the body, located in the parietal lobe. Produces sensations such as touch through using sensory information, then localises to specific body regions. Controlateral control.\n\n<b><u>Visual and auditory</u></b>\n<b>Visual centres</b>\nPrimary visual centre is the visual cortex located in the occipital love of the brain, however visual processing starts in the retina. Photoreceptors send electrical impulses to the thalamus, acting as a relay station passing the info onto the visual cortex, controlateral control. Certain areas process different things such as colour, shape or movement.\n<b>Auditory centres</b>\nLies within the temporal lobes on both sides of the brain, auditory cortex. Begins in the cochlea where sound waves are converted into nerve impulses. Then to the brain stem where basic decoding takes place (duration and intensity of a sound). Then to the thalamus where it carries out further processing and then relays the impulse to the auditory cortex where the sound is finally recognised.\n\n<b><u>Language centres</u></b>\n<b>Broca's area</b>\nBroca studied a man he referred to as 'Tan' since this was the only word he was able to say. Althoygh he was able to understand spoken language, he couldnt express his thoughts in words or through writing. Broca studied 8 other patients all with similar deficits. They had lesions to their left frontal hemisphere. Broca labelled this area as a 'language centre'.\n<b>Wernicke's area</b>\nDiscovered an area of the brain associated with the understanding of language. He found examples through people who were able to speak but not understand language. Wernicke proposed that Broca's area is associated with motor regions controlling the mouth, tongue and vocal cords and that the area he discovered was related to auditory and visual input where language is given a meaning.","<b><u>Lateralisation and split-brain research</u></b>\n<b><u>Hemispheric lateralisation</u></b>\nSome mental processes are specialised to one hemisphere in the brain. Left hemisphere for speech and language and the right hemisphere for motor and visual tasks. The two hemispheres are connected via the corpus callosum.\n\n<b><u>Split-brain research</u></b>\nThere are occasions, where it is possible to observe the effects of severing the corpus callosum. One is where patients are suffering from severe epilepsy, by severing the corpus callosum it can be ensured that an epileptic seizure is isolated to one hemisphere\n<b>Sperry and Gazzaniga</b>\nThe brain is 'crosswired' (left info goes to right hemisphere), info cannot be passed between hemispheres when corpus callosum is severed.\n<b>Method:</b> SBPs would be told to focus on a dot in the centre of their visual field. Additional information would then be presented to either visual field. SBPs asked to respond with what they saw with either their left hand (RH), right hand (RH) or verbally (LH).\n<b>Findings:</b> <li>SBPs shown image to right visual field would correctly report what they saw.</li><li>SBPs shown image to left visual field would report seeing nothing since there are no language centres in right hemisphere and severed corpus callosum means no information can be transferred across brain. However they could report it non-verbally by pointing at the object</li><li>Shown two symbols (dollar sign in left visual field and question mark in right visual field). Asked to draw with their left hand what they had seen, they drew what was in their left visual field, a dollar sign. If then asked to say out loud what they had just drawn, they would say question mark, in the right visual field.\n<b>Conclusions:</b><li>Suggests that left hemisphere is for speech and language whereas the right is for motors skills and visual-spatial processing</li><li>Stresses importance of connectivity throughout brain rather than operations of individual parts</li>","<b><u>Plasticity and functional recovery</u></b>\n\n<b><u>Plasticity</u></b>\nThe brain's ability to modify its own structure and functioning through experience. It can be affected by the following events:<ol><li><b>Life experiences</b>\nNew experiences strengthen neural pathways being used in said experiences. Rarely used pathways die out. Therefore brain constantly adapts to persons environment by strengthening the most frequently used pathways and neglecting unimportant ones. Cognitive functioning naturally declines with age however can be reversed. Boyke taught 60yr olds how to juggle and saw increased grey matter in visual cortex (changes reverted when training stopped)</li><li><b>Video Games</b>\nThey require complex cognitive and motor skills. Kuhn trained a group for 30mins a day on Super Mario for 2 months. Found significant increase in grey matter in areas such as the visual cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum compared to control group who didnt have this increase. Improved spatial navigation, strategic planning, working memory and motor performance</li><li><b>Meditation</b>\nDavidson researched Tibetan monks and a control group of volunteers who had no previous experience meditating. Students = slight increase in gamma wave activity. Monks had a much larger increase in gamma wave activity, suggests that meditation leads to plasticity in both the short and long term since the monks had far more gamma activity even before meditating.</li><b><u>Functional recovery</u></b>\nStudied stroke victims who were ragaining function, finding that the brain was rewiring itself after damage had occured to brain cells. Non damaged areas were taking over damaged areas roles and formed new circuits to improve some of the lost function. There are 3 mechanisms for recovery:<ol><li><b>Neuronal unmasking</b>\nWall identified 'dormant synapses' which were synaptic connections that exist but which dont have a function due to a too low level of neuronal input. When an area nearby is damaged, this pathway is used more, as a result it becomes 'unmasked'. Also allows for connections to regions that werent previously connected and can result in structures being developed</li><li><b>Axon sprouting</b>\nThe growth of new nerve endings, they connect to other undamaged nerve cells to create new neuronal pathways</li><li><b>Stem cells</b>\nUnspecified cells that have the potential to become many different types of cells, including nerve cells. Different possible treatments:<ol><li>Can be transplanted in, directly replacing dead/dying cells</li><li>Could secrete growth factors that can save injured cells</li><li>May form a 'neural network', linking an undamaged part of the brain to another undamaged part</li></ol></li></ol>","<b><u>Ways of studying the brain</u></b>\n<b>Postmortem</b>\n'After death', where if a patient exhibits abnormal behaviour in their life, their brain is analysed after their death, involves actual physical brain and cutting into the different structures\n<b>Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)</b>\nMeasures tha change in blood flow of particular regions within the brain. If an area is being used more it requires more oxygen which increases blood flow, enabling researchers to ask for specific tasks to be completed and then the associated regions can be found.\n<b>Electroencephalogram (EEG)</b>\nMeasures electrical activity within the brain, electrodes placed on the scalp measure tiny electrical changes which form an EEG. Can be used to detect brain disorders such as epilepsy, as well as disorders like Alzheimers. Epileptics have spikes of brain activity; brain damage causes slowing of activity. 4 types of wave patterns:<li><b>Alpha waves</b> - awake but relaxed; rhytmical waves</li><li><b>Beta waves</b> - arousal; low amplitude, high frequency</li><li><b>Theta waves</b> - first stages of sleep; low amplitude and low frequency</li><li><b>Delta waves</b> - deeper waves; slower and lower</li>\n<b>Event-related potenials (ERPs)</b>\nMakes use of EEG technology, tiny changes in voltage changes are triggered by events or stimuli that are presented e.g. cognitive processing of a specific stimulus.

This sort of research is from Sigmund Freuds research, he viewed feminimity as failed masculinity, regarding men as superior to women. Suggests penis envy and due to the fact that the superego is developed from the Oedipus conflict, it suggests women must be morally inferior since they have a weaker identification to their mothers\n\n<b>Beta bias</b>\nMistakenly minimising the differences between men and women. Results in one gender (usually women) being ignored. Fight or flight is an example of this. Biological research was conducted with male animals due to female hormone variations making it a challenge to research. It was assumed that women also had the same response however Taylor found that women actually 'Tend and Befriend'\n\n<b>Universality</b>\nThe aim to develop theories that apply to all people, as opposed to identifying superiority, identifying and acknowledging differences","<b><u>Culture bias</u></b>\n<b>Alpha bias</b>\nAssuming that there are real differences between cultures, such as assuming individualist cultures to be less conformist than collectivist cultures since they are less oriented to group norms. However, Takano and Osaka found that this was not the case (no real differences)\n\n<b>Beta bias</b>\nTheories that minimise differences or simply ignore the differences between different cultures. Assume people are the same so there are no real differnces between cultures and theories can be applied to all cultures with no issues. One example would be applying an IQ test to certain cultures, since it was developed by Western psychologists, viewing intelligence as an individual trait rather than a group trait. This is an example of <b>imposed etic</b> whereby a certain culture devises a research method or test and tries to apply it to other cultures assuming results will be valid\n\n<b><u>Ethnocentrism</u></b>\nThe tendancy to use ones own culture as a basis for judging other cultures, assuming ones own is the 'norm'.\n\n<b>Alpha bias</b>\nBy considering ones own culture as different/superior, alpha bias is introduced, devaluing other cultures.\n<b>Beta bias</b>\nThis can also occur from ethnocentrism since tests can be made, assuming all cultures will be equally represented and fairly judged from the outcome of said research.\n\n<b><u>Cultural relativism</u></b>\nThe idea that all cultures are worthy of respect and we should try to understand the particular way a culture sees the world\n\n<b>Alpha bias</b>\nThe issue with assuming real differences can lead to ignoring or missiong out on universal behaviours between cultures\n<b>Beta bias</b>\nAssuming same rules apply to all cultures is a beta bias and it can lead to misdiagnosing people, some cultures may see the behaviour as normal","<b><u>Free will and determinism</u></b>\n\n<b><u>Determinism</u></b>\n<b>Soft determinism</b>\nThe idea that there is some free will involved in human behaviours, not all determined but free will is limited to certain things through determinism\n<b>Hard determinism</b>\nThe idea that behaviour is fully predetermined and humans dont have any form of free will over their actions<b>\n\nBiological determinism</b>\nThe idea that our behaviour is down to our genetic makeup, e.g. gene related to intelligence has been identified by Hill.

Uses methods such as: unstructured interviews, case studies and thematic analysis\n\nOne example of this is Little Hans, a case study researched by Sigmund Freud. His documentation consisted of around 150 pages of quotes from Hans' Father and descriptions of Hans' life. Humanistic psychologists also take this same idiographic approach\n\n<b><u>The nomothetic approach</u></b>\nThis approach aims to create general laws for human behaviour through studying large groups and calculating averages on quantitative data.\n<b>Quantitative research</b> is conducted on these groups, using things such as measures of central tendancy and dispersion.\n\nExamples of this can be seen in things such as the biological approach, behaviourist approach and cogntitive psychology","<b><u>Ethical implications of research</u></b>\n\n<b><u>The research process</u></b>\nSieber and Stanley identified four parts of the research process where ethical issues/social consequences may occur:<li><b>The research question</b> - Asking certain questions ('are there differences in IQ between races') may be damaging since it appears to add scientific credibility to a prejudice</li><li><b>Conduct of research and treatment of ppts</b> - Mainly issues regarding confidentiality (if crime committed, do you keep confidentiality)</li><li><b>The institutional context</b> - Funding for certain research may be provided by institutions whom may misuse the results or may misunderstand them, media may obtain the research and misreport findings too</li><li><b>Interpretation and application of findings</b> - Research results could be applied to things other than what the original research was aimed at, IQ tests, originally devised to simply test intelligence, then used to determine superiority of intellect between races, used to identify the 'feeble-minded' who could then be sterilised in the early 20th century in the US\n\n<b><u>The All Trials Campaign</u></b>\nDrug treatments are funded by pharmeceutical companies who will use selective publication in order to make their drug look more favourable so they dont lose money.

Two structures in the limbic system associated with aggression:<ul style='margin-left:25px;'><li><b>The amygdala</b> - quickly evaluates emotional importance of sensory inputs, leads to appropriate response. Kluver and Bucy, discovered that the destruction of amygdala in a monkey who was dominant in a social group caused it to lose its dominant place in the group</li>\n<li><b>The hippocampus</b> - involved in the formation of long term memories, allows animals to link a certain stimulus with fear/aggression for future encounters with stimulus. A faulty hippocampus may prevent the nervous system from giving meaningful context to stimuli which may cause the amygdala to respond innapropriately, leading to aggressive behaviour. Boccardi found that habitually violent offenders exhibited abnormalities of hippocampal functioning</li></ul><b>Serotonin</b>\nAt normal levels, produces a general calming effect on neuronal firing. Typically inhibits firing of the amygdala. As a result, if serotonin levels are low then individuals less able to control impulsive and aggressive behaviour, becomes more active when stimulated as a result. Serotonin is also thought to reduce anger by inhibiting responses to emotional stimuli that would otherwise lead to an aggressive response. Denson found that normal levels of serotonin in orbitofrontal cortex is linked with reduced firing of neurons which leads to greater self-control.\n\n<b><u>Hormonal influences</u></b>\n<b>Testosterone</b>\nProduces male characteristics, one of which is thought to be aggressive behaviour. Thought to have an impact due to its effects on brain areas that are linked with aggression, removing the sources of testosterone results in much less aggression. At an age where testosterone concentration is at its highest, male-on-male aggression is increased (Daly and Wilson)","<b><u>Genetic factors in aggression</u></b>\n<b>Twin studies</b>\nCoccaro - male adult MZ twins (100% shared DNA), concordance rate of physical aggression is 50% as opposed to 19% for DZ twins\n\n<b>Adoption studies</b>\nSimilarities for aggression between adopted children and their biological parents suggest genetic influence in aggression. Rhee and Waldman - meta-analysis, concluded that adoptees who have aggressive tendancies, 41% of the differences in rates of aggressive behaviour is due to genetics\n\n<b>MAOA gene</b>\nMAOA is an enzyme that functions in the brain by 'mopping up' left over neurotransmitters in the brain after a nerve impulse has been transmitted. Breaks down the neurotransmitter - mainly serotonin. As a result, a dysfunction in the MAOA gene may lead to abnormally aggressive behaviour due to less usable serotonin being available in the brain. Brunner studies 28 males in a Dutch family who all exhibited aggressive behaviours. Found that there were low levels of MAOA activity in their brains.\n\n<b>Gene-environment interaction</b>\nGenes work in combination with the environment, MAOA needs to be paired with early traumatic events for aggressive behaviours to occur. Frazzetto found a link between higher levels of aggressive behaviour and MAOA gene in adults males however this was only true if they had experiences some form of traumatic event in the first 15 years of their life, otherwise increased aggressive tendancies were not present.","<b><u>The ethological explanation</u></b>\nThe ethological explanation seeks to understand how animals act innately through studying them in their natural environments. This explanation suggests aggression is adaptive since it involves dominant animals being more aggressive and as such surviving and passing on genes, leading to the innate factor.\n\n<b>Ritualistic aggression</b>\nSeries of behaviours carried out in set order. Lorenz found that fights between the same species rarely lead to much harm or death, this would meant that the population would die out, one of the animals will end the fight with an appeasement display, accepting they lost. Wolves for example expose their neck to the other wolf so that they are admitting defeat.\n\n<b><u>IRMs and FAPs</u></b>\n<b>Innate releasing mechanisms</b>\nAn inbuilt physiological process (network of neurons in the brain) that, when triggered by the environmental stimulus <b>(sign stimulus)</b>, will activate or 'release' a set of specific behaviours, known as a fixed action pattern\n<b>Fixed action pattern</b>\nAccording to Lea, FAPs have 6 features:<ul style='margin-left:25px;'><li>Stereotyped, relatively unchanging sequence</li><li>Universal, same in each individual in a species</li><li>Unaffected by learning</li><li>Ballistic, one pattern of behaviours is triggered, must be fully completed</li><li>Single-purpose, used in one specific scenario</li><li>A response to an indentifiable sign stimulus</li></ul><b><u>Tinbergens research</u></b>\n<b>Method:</b> Male sticklebacks, they are very territorial in mating season, they develop a red underbelly. If another male enters the territory a FAP is released. It red underbelly is a sign stimulus which triggers the IRM. Tinbergen exposed sticklebacks to a variety of differently shaped and coloured wooden models.\n<b>Results:</b> regardless of shape, if there is a red underbelly on the wooden models then the sticklback displayed aggressive behaviour and attacked it. If no red spot, then no aggression shown","<b><u>Evolutionary explanations of human aggression</u></b>\n\n<b><u>Sexual jealousy</u></b>\nMen can never be 100% sure about whether or not a child is theirs.\nThis paternity uncertainty is a result of a fear of cuckoldry - leads to a waste of resources and your genes arent passed on\nAggressive strategies are often deployed by men to reain their partners\n\n<b><u>Wilson and Daly</u></b>\n<ul style='margin-left:25px;'><li><b>Direct guarding</b> - male vigilance over a partners whereabouts and activities, tracking them</li><li><b>Negative inducements</b> - threats of dire consequences if their partner leaves them</li></ul>Such behaviours are clearly linked to violence, of women who identified these behaviours in their partners, 73% required medical attention and 53% said they feared for their lives\n\n<b><u>Intimate partner violence - Shackelford</u></b>\nMen and women in 107 married couples (of over a year) completed different questionnaires. Men completed mate retention inventory and women completed spouse influence report, measuring the extent to their partners violence in their relationship. Found a strong positive correlation between mens reports of mate retention strategies and womens reports of physical violence.\n\n<b><u>Evolutionary explanation of bullying - Volk</u></b>\nOccurs due to a power imbalance, might be an adaptive strategy. Volk found that characteristics associated with bullying are often found attractive. In men, links with dominance, acquisition of resources, strength etc. Female bullying however is a method of controlling a partner, used to secure a partners fidelity.","<b><u>The frustration-aggression hypothesis</u></b>\nDollard devised this hypothesis which claims that all aggression is a result of frustration. He defined frustration as \n\'any event or stimulus that prevents an individual from attaining some goal and its accomanying reinforcing quality\n\nFrustration leads to arousal of aggressive drive, which leads to aggressive behaviour. The aggressive behaviour leads to a cathartic effect as the aggressive urges are relieved due to aggressive behaviour.\n\n<b><u>Justified and unjustified frustration</u></b>\nDoob and Sears asked participants to imagine how they would feel in a number of different frustrating situations. One example is sitting at a bustop waiting for a bus and the bus goes past you without stopping. Participants agreed this would make them angry. Pastore then distinguished between two types of frustration, justified and unjustified. If the event was given some sort of justification (e.g. bus had not in service sign) then participants expressed much lower levels of anger.\n\n<b><u>Displaced aggression</u></b>\nDollards hypothesis states than when frustrated, people have a drive to be aggressive towards the object of the frustration. But what about when this isnt possible? Dollard assumed that aggression is sometimes displaced onto someone or something else. This is the case due to:<li>Punishment - being aggressive to teacher will get you punished</li><li>Physically incapable - object of frustration would physically overpower you</li><li>Abstract entity - the source of your frustration isnt a direct being, the bank or the government</li>Also referred to as the 'kick the dog' effect, this gives people catharsis\n\n<b><u>Revised frustration-aggression hypothesis - Berkowitz</u></b>\nOne issue with Dollards F-A hypothesis is that sometimes aggression can occur in the absence of frustration, and that frustration doesn't necessarily lead to frustration. Berkowitz instead suggested that aggression can be caused by anything that results in an unpleasant/negative feeling. Anything that interferes with reaching someones goal can lead to aggression, unanticipated interferences cause more aggression.","<b><u>Social learning theory</u></b>\nThis involves leraning through observing others and imitating behaviours that are rewarded. Aggressive behaviours can therefore also be explained by SLT, if an aggressive behaviour is observed and it has a positive consequence for the model (positive reinforcement) and the individual is physically capable of completing the behaviours themselves then they will view it as acceptable.\nThis is an example of <b>mediational processes:</b><li>Attention</li><li>Retention<li>Replication</li><li>Motivation</li>\n<b>Vicarious reinforcement</b>\nThis is where an individual witnesses someone else being reinforced for completing a certain behaviour which in turn leads to them recreating it. Vicarious punishment is the same but where a behaviour is avoided since an individual witnesses someone else being punished for completing said behaviour.\n\n<b>Self efficacy</b>\nThis is the extent to which we believe that our actions will achieve a defined goal, the more certain we are that a behaviour will impact us in a positive way, the more likely we will do it","<b><u>De-individuation theory</u></b>\nA psychological state whereby people lose their personal identity and take on the identity of a social group. Concept used by Gustave Le Bon and some certain conditions are needed:<li>Darkness</li><li>Drugs</li><li>Alcohol</li><li>Unifmorms</li><li>Masks</li><li>Disguises</li>\nIt is the anonymity that shapes this crowd behaviour, individuals have less fear of retribution if you are a small and unidentifiable part of a faceless crowd. We lose constraint and exhibit true freedom.\n\n<b><u>Prentice-Dunn and Rogers</u></b>\nSaid that this behaviour isnt directly due to anonymity but instead the consequences of anonymity. Explained in two types of self awareness:<li>Private self-awareness: how we pay attention to our own feelings and behaviour, reduced when we are in a crowd. Less self-critical</li><li>Public self-awareness: how much we care about what other people think about our behaviour and also reduced in crowds</li>\n<b><u>Dodd - De-individuation study</u></b>\nDodd asked 229 of his psychology undergraduate students if they could do anything humanly possible and not be detected or held accountable for their actions, what would they do. Students were aware their responses were completely anonymous.\nDodd found that 36% of responses were antisocial behaviour or some sort, 26% of the responses were criminal acts, most common being 'rob a bank'. A few students opted for murder, rape and assassination. Only 9% was prosocial behaviour.\n\n<b><u>Zimbardo</u></b>\n<b>Method:</b> Four female participants required to deliver electric shocks to another student to 'aid learning'. Half of the participants wore bulky lab coats and hoods that hid their faces. Never referred to by name. Other participants wore normal clothes and given name tags.\n<b>Results:</b> Participants in the de-individuation condition were more likely to press a button that they believed would shock a 'victim' in another room. They held the shock button down for twice as long as identifiable participants","<b><u>Institutional aggression in prisons</u></b>\nInstitutional aggression refers to aggressive acts that are found in particularly violent institutions, such as prisons. Two explanations for such aggression:\n\n<b><u>The deprivation model (situational explanation)</u></b>\nClemmer stated that harsh prison conditions cause stress for inmates, they cope with this stress by resorting to aggressive behaviour, which, as previously discussed, can have a cathartic effect on the exhibitor. The stressful conditions experienced by inmates consist of:<li>Deprivation of freedom</li><li>Heat and noise</li><li>Overcrowding</li><li>Safety</li><li>Heterosexuality</li>A deprivation of material goods leads to an increased competition\n\nPrison regime itself can be restrictive and frustrating due to frequent and unpredictable 'lock ups' which reduces the already limited stimulation the inmates recieve.\n\n<b>Steiner</b> - investigated factors affecting inmate aggression within 512 prisons in the US. He found inmate-on-inmate violence was more common in prisons where there were higher proportions of female-staff, African American inmates, Hispanic inmates, and inmates in protective custody for their own safety. They are all prison level factors that lead to an increase in violence that are not down to the individuals, coinciding with the situational explanation.\n\n<b><u>The importation model (dispositional explanation)</u></b>\nIrwin and Cressey argued that prison life isnt entirely secluded from the outside happenings of the 'real world'. Inmates bring their own real life experiences and subcultures into the prison. This suggests that aggression within the prison is down to the individuals in the prison rather than the environment itself. Suggests inmates would act aggressively regardless of their location.\n\n<b>DeLisi</b> - studied 813 juvenile delinquents confined in institutions in California. Found that those inmates whom had several negative dispositional factors such as experiences of childhood trauma, substance abuse etc. were more likely to engage in suicidal activity, sexual misconduct, violent behaviour and were also more likely to gain attention of guards (compared to control)\n\nGang members have been found to engage in more aggressive and violent behaviour within the prison environment, this means the behaviour is down the individual since they exhibited aggressive behaviour outside of prison and are also more likely to exhibit similar behaviour in the prison","<b><u>Media influences on aggression</u></b>\nMedia consists of things such as TV, film and books whereby entertainment, education and data are made available\nComputer games are where an individual virtually engages in a variety of different activities including things such as simulations, fps, adventures, sports often using online services.\n\nDifferent methodologies are used: experimental studies, correlational, longitudinal, meta-analysis\n\n<b><u>Bartholow and Anderson - Experiment</u></b>\n↪ Students either played violent or non-violent video games\n↪ They played for 10 minutes and then completed a standard lab measure of aggression test (Taylor Competitive Reaction Time Task), delivering blasts of white noise at chosen volumes to punish non-existent opponents\n↪ Those who played violent video games chose higher noise of 85 decibels rather than the other group who selected 77.5 decibels\n\n<b><u>DeLisi - Correlational</u></b>\n↪ Studied 227 juvenile offenders, all with histories of aggression\n↪ Structured interviews based on aggressive behaviours and video games\n↪ Aggressive behaviour significantly correlated with how often violent video games were played\n\n<b><u>Robertson - Longitudinal</u></b>\n↪ Studied 1037 people born in New Zealand\n↪ measured TV viewing from birth until 26 years of age\n↪ Found time spent watching TV was a reliable predictor for aggressive behaviour in adulthood, measured in convictions and violent crimes\n↪ More time watching TV meant more likely to be diagnosed with antisocial disorder\n\n<b><u>Anderson - Meta-analysis</u></b>\n↪ Meta-analysis of 136 studies\n↪ Exposure to violent computer games was associated with increased aggressive behaviours, thoughts and feelings\n↪ True for males, females, individualist and collectivist cultures\n↪ Seemingly no publication bias influencing results","<b><u>Explanations of media influences</u></b>\nDesensitisation, Disinhibition and Cognitive Priming\n\n<b><u>Desensitisation</u></b>\nNormally when exposed to violent behaviour we have a physiological response, arousal from the sympathetic nervous system. However upon repeat viewing of such aggressive and violent media, desensitisation occurs. Stimuli lose their impact, leading to reduced anxiety. This results in less empathy and negative attitudes towards violence weakening.\n\n<b>Weisz and Earls - Desensitisation</b>\nShows ppts Straw Dogs, contains a prolonged and graphic rape scene. Participant s then watched a re-enactment of a rape trial. Compared to males who watched a non-sexually violent film. Those who watched Straw Dogs showed a greater acceptance of rape myths and sexual aggression, expressing less sympathy in the trial for the victim.\n\n<b><u>Disinhibition</u></b>\nMost people hold the view that violence and aggression are antisocial and harmful. These beliefs are powerful inhibitors and are learned directly and indirectly through SLT. Watching media characters being rewarded however means that inhibitors are reduced as it becomes viewed as more justified if the consequences are minimised in media\n\n<b><u>Cognitive Priming</u></b>\nRepeated viewing of aggressive media, especially game playing, can provide us with a 'script' like a schema, about how violent situations are to play out. Huesmann claims this script is stored in memory, we become 'primed' to be aggressive. A mostly automatic process, the script is as follows:<ol style='margin-left:25px;'><li>Encounter social problem</li><li>Evaluate cues</li><li>Search for script</li><li>Evaluate script</li><li>Behave according to script</li></ol><b>Greitemeyer</b>\nLooked at priming of aggressive scripts in memory through song lyrics. Male ppts listened to songs with aggressively derogatory lyrics about women. After listening to mysogynistic songs, were able to recall more negative characteristics of women and behaved more aggressively towards a female confederate, in comparison to neutral songs."],
        ["schizophrenia","<b><u>Classification of schizophrenia</u></b>\nThe DSM-V states that two or more of the following symptoms, cant both be negative. Can be only one symptom if they are bizzare delusions, or if they are hallucinations that consist of running commentary or conversation. Also the symptoms need to affect livelihood, prevent you from functioning in society and must have been present for at least 6 months\n\n<b><u>Positive symptoms</u></b>\n<li><b>Hallucinations</b> - sensory malfunction, perceiving the environment incorrectly. Things such as seeing things that arent there, hearing things that arent there (running commentary, body parts talking), smelling things that arent there</li><li><b>Delusions</b> - Incorrect/bizzare beliefs, as opposed to perceptions. Paranoid delusions e.g. fearing someone is watching you. Consists of<ol style='margin-left:25px;'><li><b>Delusions of grandeur</b> - believing people are out to get you, inflated self-importance</li><li><b>Delusions of reference</b> - believing that there are secret messages, designed only for you to receive</li></ol><li><b>Disorganised speech</b> - de-railment, constantly switching between topics of speech, muddled words, abnormal thought processes affect thoughts</li><li><b>Grossly disorganised/catatonic behaviour</b> - Cant start/complete task due to lack of focus, little movement, rigid postures\n\n<b><u>Negative symptoms</u></b>\n<li><b>Alogia - Speech poverty</b> - slowed/blocked thoughts limit speech and productivity</li><li><b>Avolition</b> - less interest/desire for things, cant begin any meaningful behaviour</li><li><b>Affective flattening</b> - emotions seem flat or may not be appropriate for the situation (laughing at funeral)</li><li><b>Anhedonia</b> - loss of pleasure in all/most activities, can be physical or social\n\nChildhood schizophrenia is rare\nSame prevelance for genders, men get it 5-10 years earlier\nEpisodic illness - comes and goes\nEstimated 1% of the population have a chance of suffering\nRealistically 1 in 1000","<b><u>Reliability and Validity in diagnosis and classification</u></b>\n\n<b>Co-morbidity</b>\nThis is where two or more disorders are diagnosed in one person. Buckley said that around 50% of schizophrenics are also diagnosed with depression, while around 47% suffer from substance abuse, which may lead to issues with self care and regard for health\n\n<b>Culture bias</b>\nMajor issue, the assumption that SZ manifests equally across all cultures, diagnosed incorrectly across other ethnicities (beta bias). Diagnosis is based on Western concepts, makes it hard to apply to non western concepts. Copeland found that 69% of US psychiatrists would diagnose a patient with SZ whilst only 2% of UK psychiatrists diagnosing that same patient. May therefore lead to false diagnoses\n\n<b>Symptom overlap</b>\nWhere symptoms of different disorders are similar in nature so its hard to correctly distinguish between what is the actual disorder. Ellason and Ross found that patients with D.I.D would have more symptoms of SZ than required to be classed as schizophrenic however this is of course another disorder.\n\n<b>Gender bias</b>\nBroverman suggested that the concept of mental health upon which diagnoses are based off of, are based on male health. This suggests a sort of beta bias since it leads to males and females being diagnosed equally, ignoring potential differences for female behaviour. Can lead to misdiagnosis","<b><u>Biological explanations for schizophrenia</u></b>\n<b>Family studies</b>\nGottesman, located SZs and determined whether biological relatives were more likely to also suffer from Sz. Found that:<li>Children with 2 schizophrenic parents = 46% concordance rate</li><li>Children with 1 Ss parent = 13% concordance rate</li><li>Children with Sz sibling = 9% concordance rate</li>Therefore the greater the genetic similarity, the higher the risk of Sz\n\n<b>Twin studies</b>\nJoseph, monozygotic twins share 100% of their genes, diozygotic only 50% - hence concordance should be much higher in MZ twins than DZ twins. Joseph found:<li>MZ twins = 40.4% concordance rate</li><li>DZ twins = 7.4% concordance rate</li>\n\n<b>Adoption studies</b>\nStudies that separate parents and children - disentangling nature and nurture. Tienari found, in his Finnish adoption study:<li>Of 164 adoptees with Sz mothers; 6.7% ended up with schizophrenia</li><li>Of 197 adoptees with non-Sz mothers; 2% ended up with Sz</li>\n\n<b><u>Neural correlates</u></b>\nRelationship between brain structure function and symptoms of Sz\n\n<b><u>The dopamine hypothesis</u></b>\nToo much dopamine in certain areas in the brain casuses positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Messages from neurons that transmit dopamine fire too quickly and/or too often. Schizophrenics are thought to have abnormally high numbers of D₂ receptors\n\n<b>Dopamine agonists</b>\nAmphetamines, stimulates the nerve cells containing dopamine, causes synapse to be flooded with this neurotransmitter. Non-Sz can experience charactersitic hallucinations and delusions of a schizophrenic episode if they have taken a large-dose of dopamine releasing drugs.\n\n<b>Dopamine antagonists</b>\nThese are drugs that block certain activity of dopamine in the brain, reduces activity in the neural pathways of the brain that use dopamine as a neurotransmitter. These eliminate certain positive symptoms of schizophrenia such as hallucination.\n\n<b><u>The revised dopamine hypothesis: Davis & Kahn</u></b>\nPositive symptoms = excess of dopamine in subcortical areas of the brain\nNegative symptoms = deficit of dopamine in prefrontal cortex (social behaviour, personality)\n\nEvidence that was used is from neural imaging - Patel used PET scans and found lower levels of dopamine in prefrontal cortex of Szs compared to control group.\nAnimal studies - Wang & Deutch - depleted dopamine in the prefrontal cortex of rats, lead to cogntitive impairement (negative symptoms), could be reversed using atypical antipsychotics. Suggests that varying levels of dopamine leads to schizophrenic symptoms","<b><u>Biological treatments for schizophrenia</u></b>\nDrug therapies are only effective for 2/3 of all schizophrenics. The rationale is that if schizophrenia is caused by too high a level of dopamine, then drugs that reduce levels of dopamine will relieve symptoms\n\n<b><u>Antipsychotics</u></b>\nThese help reduce severe schizophrenics symptoms, work by reducing dopamine levels in the brain. Can improve day to day functioning and increase wellbeing. Two main types for schizophrenics:\n\n<b>Typical antipsychotics (conventional)</b>\nAntagonists - bind to but do not stimulate dopamine receptors, blocking the action of dopamine. As a result, reduce positive symptoms of schizophrenia.\nKapur - found that between 60-75% of D₂ receptors in mesolimbic pathway must be blocked in order for the drugs to be effective. Blocks dopamine receptors all across the brain indiscriminately, this leads to side effects.\n\n<b>Atypical antipsychotics</b>\n2nd generation of antipsychotics. Has 3 main differences to typical antipsychotics:<li>lower risk of side effects</li><li>suitable for treatment-resistant patients</li><li>can help negative symptoms and cognitive impairment</li>\nUnlike typical antipsychotics that block D₂ receptors, these 'rapdily dissasociate' which means that they bind to the D₂ receptors and then rapidly break off which allows for normal dopamine functioning as opposed to excessive (schizophrenia) or none (typical antipsychotics).\nAtypical also has a stronger affinity with serotonin receptors as well, further dinstinguishing them from typical antipsychotics","<b><u>Psychological explanations for schizophrenia</u></b>\nSZs have dysfunctional thought processes, can lead to symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations\n\n<b>Cognitive explanations of delusions</b>\nHow far a person sees themselves as the central component of events <b>(ego bias)</b>. SZs have delusions because they <b>jump to conclusions</b>, about random events irrelevant to them, coming to false conclusions. They are resistant to <b>reality testing</b> due to impaired insight - inability to recognise cognitive distortions so cant come up with logical conclusions for events.\n\n<b>Cognitive explanations of hallucinations</b>\nSZs hear voices more because they pay excessive attention to auditory stimuli, <b>hypervigilance</b>. They expect to hear voices. Aleman said that SZs find it hard to distinguish between inner representation of an idea and the actual sensory stimuli (what a person imagines may override what is actually there). They also dont reality check these hallucinations.\n\n<b><u>Family dysfunction</u></b>\nSuggests schizophrenic episodes are caused by tension/trauma/abnormal communication within the family\n\n<b>Double bind</b>\nChildren who frequently recieve contradictory messages from parents are likely to develop SZ. ('you look tired, you should go to bed' may sound caring but be said in a way that sounds like 'you are bothering me')\nChild becomes confused by contradictory messages and cannot respond appropriately. This prevents them from developing a coherent version of reality\n\n<b>Expressed Emotion</b>\nSuggests families where emotions run high are more likely to lead to schizophrenia e.g. criticism, hostility, emotional over-involvement.\nThe emotions may be beyond what certain people can cope with and so it leads to stress, this stress overloads their already impaired coping mechanism and an episode is triggered. Things such as 'I've been worried sick, how could you do this to me'","<b><u>CBTp</u></b>\nRationale: drug treatments often still leave schizophrenics with many residual symptoms, CBTp is designed to help those patients who are already on drugs to learn how to manage these residual symptoms in order to cope with everyday life\nCBTp aims to help patients correct faulty thoughts and distorted beliefs which can lead to maladaptive emotions and actions. By teaching patients to monitor their behaviour, they can learn to consider alternative ways of explaining why they feel and behave the way they do. Should reduce stress and improve functioning.\n6 stages involved:<ol><li>Assessment - patient expresses thoughts and feelings, therapist comes up with realistic goals to achieve</li><li>Engagement - therapist empathises with patient</li><li>ABC model - patient explains their activating event and it is discussed why it lead to such a belief</li><li>Normalisation - patient is reminded that its not unusual and there are others like them, this reduces stress</li><li>Critical collaboration analysis - gentle questioning to try get patient to understand that their thought processes are illogical</li><li>Developing alternative explanations - coming up with different, healthier explanations to disrupt illogical thinking patterns</li>","<b><u>Family therapy</u></b>\nA range of interventions aimed at family members, helps them learn about schizophrenia so they can learn to support and be more patient with their SZ relative.\n3-12 month period of about 10 sessions\nFocuses on reducing levels of EE and encourages listening, problem solving and negotiation\n\n<b>5 features</b><li>Psychoeducation</li><li>Forming alliance</li><li>Reducing EE</li><li>Improving problem solving skills</li><li>Reasonable expectations</li>\n\n<b>Pharoah</b>\nReviewed 53 studies to investigate effectivness of family therapy compared to standard care (meds alone)\n\nComparisons: <li>Mental state - mixed overall impression, some reported improvement, others did not</li><li>Compliance with medication - did increase compliance</li><li>Social functioning - appearing to show improvement but not much effect on functioning independently</li><li>Reduction in relapse - there was a reduction in relapse rate</li>","<b><u>Token economy</u></b>\nA system whereby schizophrenics are rewarded with tokens if they act in a positive/socially acceptable way, these tokens can be traded in for certain privilages. This is aimed at reducing negative symptoms of schizophrenia\n\n<b>Concepts behind token economy</b>\n<li>Based on operant conditioning, specifically reinforcement</li><li>desirable behaviours are encouraged thorugh secondary reinforcement in the form of these tokens</li><li>Tokens can be exchanged for primary reinforcers such as special food or privilages</li><li>Value must be constantly assigned to the tokens so that patients strive to get them by completing positive behaviours</li>\nTrade must occur quickly after token handed in so that association is formed","<b><u>Interactionist approach</u></b>\nRationale: SZ is an interaction between biological and environmental factors.\nVulnerability to SZ is biological; whether it develops depends on presence of an environmental trigger\n\n<b>Diathesis</b>\n↪Genetic basis\n↪Twin studies show concordance rate of 40.4% in MZ twins, means that in about half cases Sz never occurs. May be due to environmental trigger than sets SZ off\n\n<b>Stress</b>\n↪Psychological factors such as childhood trauma. Varese found children who experienced trauma before aged 16 were 3x more likely to develop SZ in later life compared to those who didnt experience such trauma\n↪Could also be environmental factors such as urbanisation, Vassos found SZ risk was 2.32 times higher in urban settings than in rural settings. This could be due to excessive noise, pollution, adverse living conditions, stress etc.\n\n<b><u>Diathesis & Stress can be additive</u></b>\nThey 'add' together to total SZ, a person with a large genetic vulnerabilty may only need a small stress trigger to push them over; a person with less vulnerability may need a bigger trigger"],       
        ["relationships","<b><u>Sexual selection and human reproductive behaviour</u></b>\n<b>Sexual selection</b>\nExplains why some characteristics that may seem disadvantageous may have advantages in terms of human reproductive behaviour. Could be that the characteristics are attractive for possible mates or also that they may enable you to best competitors in reproductive rights. (certain height, body/facial features)\n\n<b>Anisogamy</b>\nRefers to the differences between male and female gametes (sex cells):<li>Male gametes - sperm, extremely small, highly mobile, created in vast numbers from puberty to old age, dont require lots of energy to produce</li><li>Female gametes - eggs/ova are relatively large, produces at intervals for a limited number of fertile years and require a huge investment of energy\n\nAs a result there is no shortage of fertile men, fertile women are a rare 'resource'</li>\n<b>Inter-sexual selection</b>\nQualities that make individuals more desirable for the opposite sex. Enables those members of that sex a mating advantage over those who dont have these qualities. This is mainly used by women since an incorrect mate has more severe consequences for women than men (more time and resources used); as such they choose quality over quantity. A females optimum strategy is a genetically fit male who is able and willing to provide resources.\nRunaway process - genes from fathers passed on to sons. Fisher 'sexy sons' hypothesis, desirable traits are passed on to sons from fathers and they lead to more successive generations and offspring.\n\n<b>Intra-sexual selection</b>\nRefers to the competition between sexes to be able to have a better chance of mating with the other sex. Preferred strategy of males; quantity over quality. Larger males have an advantage and so are more likely to have mating opportunities with more women. May benefit from aggressive behaviour or thinking in certain ways. Quantity over quality due to ease of creating large quanitities of sperm and also lack of post-coital responsibilities\n\nDimorphism - characteristics are different between men and women, this is because certain characteristics served no reproductive or evolutionary benefit, women have no need to be large since in the past men acquired resources.","<b><u>Factors affecting attraction #1: Self-disclosure</u></b>\nThe process of purposefully revealing significant information about oneself that would not normally be known by others.\nThere is an element of risk involved, the information is ranked as follows:<ol><li>cliches</li><li>facts</li><li>opinions</li><li>personal feelings</li><li>peak (very secret)</li></ol>\n<b><u>Social penetration theory</u></b>\nAltman and Taylor states that self-disclosure is the process of gradually revealing your inner self to someone. In romantic relationships we give away our deepest thoughts and feelings in a reciprocal exchange. When revealing information, the other person then must also go ahead and reveal personal information, in this way the two people penetrate more deeply into each others' lives\n\n<b><u>Breadth and Depth</u></b>\nAt the start we disclose a lot of low level superficial information, low-risk (breadth)\nAs the relationship starts developing, self-disclosure becomes deeper and encompases a wider range of topics. If too much deep information is revealed at the start, it may put the relationship in jeopardy.\n\n<b><u>Reciprocity of self-disclosure</u></b>\nReis and Shaver state that breadth and depth of self-disclosure isnt enough, requires a reciprical element involved for the relationship to develop. Hopefully when you reveal something, your partner responds in a way that is rewarding with understanding, and then share their own intimate thoughts and feelings. In this way there is a balance between partners\n\n<b>If someone self-discloses lots of personal information at the start less attraction occurs and it may be viewed as inappropriate</b>","<b><u>Factors affecting attraction #2: Physical attractiveness</u></b>\n<b>The importance of physical attractivness</b>\nOne explanation is the evolutionary theory, Shackelford and Larson found symmetrical faces were deemed as attractive since it is perceived as an honest signal of genetic fitness (symmetry is hard to fake)\n\nPeople are also attracted to neotenous facial features (baby face) such as large eyes since it triggers a protective/caring instinct.\n\nNot only important at the start, McNulty found that the physical attractiveness that brought a couple together continued to be an important factor later on in their relationship.\n\n<b>The halo effect</b>\nPhysical attractiveness may lead to the preconceived notion that a person has positive traits. Dion found that physically attractive people were consistently rated as kind, strong, sociable and successful compared to physically unattractive people.\nThis belief may lead us to treat them more positively which leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy. Shows that physical attractiveness has a disproportionate amount of influence on our judgements.\n\n<b>The matching hypothesis</b>\nAlthough we find physical attractiveness desirable, common sense tells us that we cant try to form relationships with the most attractive people. As such, a compromise is made, whereby we assess our own attractiveness and then choose partners who are roughly similar to us in attractiveness levels. Therefore we need to have a realistic judgement of our own 'value' in terms of physical attractiveness.","<b><u>Factors affecting attraction #3: Filter theory</u></b>\nKerchoff and Davis, compared the attitudes and personalities of student couples in short-term and long-term relationships. This theory states that we are initially exposed to a 'field of avaliables' but this has to be narrowed down to a 'field of desirables'. This narrowing down is completed with three filters:<ol><li>Social demography</li><li>similarity in attitudes</li><li>Complementarity</li></ol>Significance of each filter is dependent on whether the relationship is short or long term.\n\n<b>#1 Social demography</b>\nSimply key characteristics that, if shared between two people, leads to a higher likelihood that they find each other attractive. They include things like: ethnicity, religion, sexuality, social class, educational attainment and proximity\n\nProximity may 'trump' the other characteristics since it enables easy access and communication which enables a relationship to form.\nClark found that 50% of Ohio citizens were married to partners who initally lived in walking distance to their home\n\n<b>#2 Similarity in attitudes</b>\nThis is important but only for couples who had been with each other for less than 18 months, a need for agreement in earlier stages since it encourages deeper communication and prompts self-disclosure. Described as the 'law of attraction'\n\n<b>#3 Complementarity</b>\nConcerns the ability of romantic partners to meet each others needs: one has traits that the other lacks and vice versa. More important for late stages, opposites attract, gives feeling that couples when living together are whole, adding depth to the relationship","<b><u>Theories of relationships #1: Social exchange theory</u></b>\nThibault and Kelley, an economic theory that explains relationships in terms of balancing rewards and costs through a series of exchanges. The reasons behinds relationships are to minimise losses and maximise gains. Satisfaction in a relationship is judged on profits.\n\n<b>PROFTS = REWARDS - COSTS</b>\n\nRewards can be anything, things such as: companionship, sex, emotional support\nHowever it is all subjective so different people may have different rewards. Certain aspects of a relationship can be hard though and are viewed as costs. May be things such as: time, stress, energy\n\n<b>Comparison level</b>\nBased on a persons view of how much they deserve to receive in a relationship. It is subjective and based on previous experiences, e.g. if someone was treated poorly in a previous relationship, then they will expect less from their current partner since they dont feel they deserve as much. People will only get into new relationships if the comparison level is equal to or higher than their previous relationship. Comparison levels are linked to an individuals self esteem\n\n<b>Comparison level for alternatives</b>\nConcerns a persons perception of whether or not potential relationships (or being alone) would be more rewarding that being with their current partner. People will stick to thier current relationships as long as they find them more profitable than costly\n\n<b><u>Stages of relationship development</u></b>\n<ol><li>Sampling stage - exploring rewards and costs within the relationship</li><li>Barganing stage - beginning of a relationship, start exchanging various rewards and costs</li><li>Commitment stage - exchanges become more predictable and the relationship becomes more stable</li><li>Institutionalisation stage - partners are now settled down because norms are firmly established</li>","<b><u>Theories of relationships #2: Equity theory</u></b>\nWalster, both partners level of proft is roughly the same, this theory was developed in response to SET, maximising rewards and minimising costs is still important however fairness has now come into play.\nOne partners' rewards-costs should equal another partners rewards-costs. Equity is not equality however, if one partner is putting more into the relationship, they should be getting more back so that it feels fair.\n\n<b>The role of equity</b>\nA lack of equity will lead to one partner overbenefiting and the other underbenefiting which leads to dissatisfaction and unhappiness. If one partner puts lots in but doesnt get lots back they will become angry and resentful. Those who get more out of a relationship will feel guilt or shame.\n\n<b>Consequences of inequity</b>\n<u>Changes in equity</u> - Many people may feel OK doing things that they dont enjoy for the other partner initially in a relationship but not later on since it leads to dissatisfaction.\n<u>Dealing with inequity</u> - Underbenefitting partners may adjust over time and be OK with the original issue whilst overbenefiting ones may work hard to restore balance","<b><u>Theories of relationships #3: Rusbult's Investment Model</u></b>\nThe rationale behind this is that there must be an alternative explanation since couples stay together regardless of costs outweighing rewards.\n\nThree main factors that maintain commitment to a relationship:<li>Satisfaction level</li><li>Comparison with alternatives</li><li>Investment size</li>\n<b>Satisfaction and Comparison level with alternatives</b></li>\nSatisfaction is based on comparison level, a satisfying relationship is judged by comparing rewards and costs. Typically based off of previous experiences and social norms.\nComparison with alternatives is considering whether you would be happier in another relationship or simply alone.\n\n<b>Investment size</b>\nNumber of resources - tangible investment.\nHappy memories - intangible investment\n\nThings that are put into the relationship - instrinsic investments\nThings that people get out of the relationship - extrinsic investments\n\nThe bigger the investment is, the more likely people are going to stay in a relationship, therefore investment size also has an impact on commitment level in a relationship.\n\n<b>Maintenance mechanisms used to keep relationships going</b>\n<li>Accomodation - acting in a way that promotes relationships rather than keeping tally</li><li>Willingness to sacrifice</li><li>Forgiveness</li><li>Positive illusions</li><li>Ridiculing alternatives</li>","<b><u>Theories of relationships #4: Ducks Phase Model</u></b>\nReason for relationship breakdowns:<li>Marriage when partners are very young</li><li>Early parenthood</li><li>Being in a lower socioeconomic group</li><li>Poor education</li><li>Partners are of different race/religion</li><li>Greater number of sexual partners before marriage</li><li>Jealousy</li><li>Peoples change in attitudes/beliefs</li><li>Relationship becomes routine/boring</li><li>Lack of sexual satisfaction</li><li>Lack of social skills</li><li>Extra matiral affair</li>\nEnding of a relationship is not a one off event, goes through 4 distinct phases. Different thresholds the partner needs to reach at each stage. Road to break up begins when a partner realises they are dissatisfied with their relationship and distressed about the way things are going.\n\n<b><u>Phase 1: Intra-Psychic Phase</u></b>\n<u>Threshold</u> - Cant stand it anymore, determination that something must change\n<li>focus on cognitive processes</li><li>dissatisfied partner analyses reasons for being dissatisfied, focusing mostly on the partners shortcomings.</li><li>partner keeps this private, may tell a trusted friend</li><li>weigh up pros and cons about relationship and evaluate against the alternatives\n<b><u>Phase 2: Dyadic Phase</u></b>\n<u>Threshold</u> - 'I would be justified withdrawing'\n<li>focus on interpersonal processes between two partners</li><li>series of confrontations over period of time</li><li>characterised by anxiety, hostility, complaints about lack of equity, resentment over imbalanced roles</li><li>two possible outcomes - determination to break it up, or to attempt to repair</li>\n<b><u>Phase 3: Social Phase</u></b>\n<u>Threshold</u> - 'I mean it'\n<li>break up is made public, partners seek support and try to forge pacts, mutual friends 'choose a side'</li><li>some friends offer reassurance and others blame people</li>\n<b><u>Phase 4: Grave-Dressing Phase</u></b>\n<u>Threshold</u> - 'Its now inevitable'\n<li>focuses on the aftermath</li><li>each party tries to spin the story in their favour</li><li>gossip about each other and try to maintain a positive reputation</li><li>tidying up memories, and then off to 'get a new life'","<b><u>Virtual relationships in social media</u></b>\n<b>Self-disclosure in virtual relationships</b>\nThis is crucial in face to face (FTF) relationships however there are two theories regarding its role in online relationships\n\n<b><u>#1 Reduced cues theory</u></b>\nSpoull and Keisler, suggets that computer mediated communication (CMC) relationships may have a poorer level of intimacy as well as reduced self-disclosure\nVital cues such as facial expressions and voice intonations present in FTF but not in CMC are vital for understanding partners emotions. With CMC, leads to de-individuation (leads to disinhibition) of each partner meaning they are likely to be excessively blunt or impersonal and reduces likelihood of future self-disclosure and intimacy\n\n<b><u>#2 The Hyperpersonal Model</u></b>\nWalther argues that online relationships can be more personal and involve greater self-disclosure than FTF. This is because CMC relationships can develop very quickly as self-disclosure happens earlier. Once established, the relationships are more intense and intimate\nCan end more quickly since high level of excitement isnt matched with high levels of trust\nWalther states that people have more control over what they disclose online and its easier to manipulate self-disclosure to increase intimacy online.\n\nBargh points out that the outcome of this is rather like the 'strangers on a train effect', when you are aware the other person doesnt know you so you feel less accountable for your behaviour and self-disclose more\n\nFewer gates (obstacles that prevent the formation of a relationship), this is because people select more about their online presentation, so attractiveness and social anxiety and other typical gates dont come into play","<b><u>Parasocial relationships</u></b>\nA one-sided relationship with a celebrity, prominent person in the community or a fictional character, the fan knows everything about this person and feels very close to them but there is no chance of reciprocity\n\n<b>Levels of parasocial relationships</b>\nMaltby developed 3 levels through using a celebrity attitudes large scale survey\n\n<b><u>#1 Entertainment-social</u></b>\nLeast intense level. The person is simply a source of entertainment and light gossip among friends\n\n<b><u>#2 Intense-personal</u></b>\nDeeper level, more intense, may see the person as a 'soulmate', know dress sense, food they like etc.\nTypical for teenagers who seem obsessed with ever detail of a celebrities lifestyle\n\n<b><u>#3 Borderline pathological</u></b>\nTaken to extreme, fan has obsessive fantasies about celebrity, spending large amounts of money to obtain memorabilia and may engage in illegal activities such as stalking. People believe that if given a chance with a celebrity, then their feelings would be reciprocated.\n\n<b><u>The Absorption-addiction model</u></b>\nMcCutcheon explains the tendancy to form parasocial relationships to fill certain gap in peoples lives (weak sense of self-identity, lack of fulfilment). As such this may be a way of finding some fulfilment that they cannot get from their relationships.\nMay develop from level to level due to social trigger.\n\n<b>Absorption</b> - seeking fulfilment in celebrity worship, it motivates the individual to focus attention on the celebrity\n<b>Addiction</b> - individuals need to sustain their commitment in the relationship by becoming more intense which may result in obsessive tendancies\n\n<b><u>The Attachment Theory Explanation</u></b>\nBowlby suggests that those who did not form a strong bond with a primary caregiver will seek to find an attachment substitute, hence a parasocial relationship. Insecure resistant relationship types therefore are more likely to form parasocial relationships because they fear criticism and rejection from real relationships"]

Means we cant use this to distinguish between desirable and undesirable behaviours.\nX Cut-off point is subjective. People may have differing views\nX It is sometimes appropriate, any individual whose IQ is more than 2 standard deviations below the mean is judged as having a mental disorder, but only when used in conjunction with FtFA. Suggests is only one of a number of tools\n<b>Deviation from social norms</b>\nX Depends on degree and context, e.g. not wearing a top, but at the beach. Shouting loudly is deviant but not evidence of mental condition unless possibly it is excessive.\nX Some strength in that it distinguishes between desirable and undesirable behaviour. Any behaviour that deviate from social norms cause distress to others and so are undesirable.\n X Susceptible to abuse, if we define abnormality in this way, danger of creating definitions based on prevailing social morals and attitudes that may not be correct e.g. identifying homosexuality as a disorder in the past.\n<b>Failure to function adequately</b>\nX Who judges, if a person is experiencing personal distress they may recognise this and seek help. On the other hand the person may be quite content with this and or be simply unaware of the situation. So this definition depends on who is making the decision, so its subjective.\nX The behaviour may be functional, e.g. some mental disorders such as depression may lead to extra attention for the individual which is rewarding and as such is quite functional rather than dysfunctional. Hence it is an incomplete explanation since it struggles to distinguish between functional and dysfunctional.\n<b>Ideal mental health</b>\nX Unrealistic criteria, most of us are abnormal according to this criteria, also quite difficult to measure.\n&#10003; It is a positive approach, focuses on what is desirable rather than what is undesirable, has had influence on humanistic approach 'positive psychology'\nX Equates mental and physical health, physical health much easier to detect, tries to apply our knowledge of physical health to that of mental health but doesnt look at consequence of life experiences. Therefore unlikely that we can diagnose them the same either\n\n<b>ALL</b>\nX Cultural Relativism","<b><u>The behavioural approach to explaining phobias</u></b>\n&#10003; Importance of classical conditioning for forming a phobia, Sue et al found that people often recall a specific incident when their phobia appeared, such as being bitten by a dog. Some people unable to recall certain event however could be due to event since being forgotten (Ost). Sue said it may be different for certain people like for arachnophobics are more likely to cite modelling as the cause of their phobia.\nX Incomplete explanation, some people simply dont develop a fear even if neutral stimulus is associated with fearful experience. Di Nardo said that not everyone who is bitten by a dog develops a phobia of dogs. Proposes some people have a genetic vulnerability for such phobias, only develops if triggered by life experience.\n&#10003; Support for modelling, Bandura and Rosenthal, in exeriment, if model acted in pain when buzzer sounded, ppts who observed this behaviour showed an emotional response to the buzzer, showing an acquired fear response.\nSeligman proposed that certain phobias are a result of biological preparedness, suggests that animals and humans are genetically programmed to rapidly learn an association between a potentially life threatening stimuli and fear. Ancient fears, that would have been dangerous in our evolutionary past, snakes, heights, strangers, and explains why more people are scared of spiders now than cars that are actually more dangerous, considering cars are modern objects that we haven't yet developed an innate fear for.","<b><u>The behavioural approach to treating phobias</u></b>\<b><u>SD</u></b>\n&#10003; Successful for a range of phobias, McGrath reported that around 75% of people with phobias respond to SD. Key to success lies with using <i>in vivo</i> which is actually experiencing fear rather than <i>in vitro</i> which is imagining the feared stimulus or using pictures.\nX Not appropriate for all phobias, Ohman, not as effective on phobias that have evolutionary survival components (fear of dark, dangerous animals, heights). Only for personally acquired ones.\n<b>Flooding</b>\n&#10003; Effectiveness for those who stick with it, Choy reported that although both successful, flooding was more successful than SD at treating phobias, Craske reported they are equal in effectiveness. It is also quick.\nX Individual differences, flooding is not for everyone and can be highly traumatic for some people, in some cases worsening the phobia if the individual quits before completing the therapy.\n<b>Both</b>\n&#10003; Strenghts of behavioural therapies, require less effort for the patient than other therapies. CBT for example requires a willingnes for deep thought about their mental problem which doesnt apply to behavioural therapies. Means its useful for those who lack insight into their phobias and their causes or for those with learning difficulties who would be unable or at least struggle with CBT.","<b><u>The cognitive approach to explaining depression</u></b>\n&#10003; Support for the role of irrational thinking, Hammen and Krantz found that depressed ppts were more likely to make logic errors when interpreting written material than non-depressed ppts. Bates found that when giving depressed patients negative automatic-thought became more and more depressed.\n&#10003; Blames the client rather than situational factors, it gives the client the power to change how things are. However, this can make the client feel bad for not overcoming the disorder and also may lead to the therapist overlooking certain environmental factors that lead to the disorder\n&#10003; Practical applications in therapy, this approach has lead to effective therapies in CBT.\nX Irrational thoughts may be realistic, limitation is that not all irrational thoughts are actually 'irrational', Alloy and Abramson suggested that depressed people actually tend to see the world more realistically and 'normal' people see the world through rose-coloured glasses. This is called the <i>sadder but wiser</i> effect.","<b><u>The cognitive approach to treating depression</u></b>\n&#10003; Ellis claimed a 90% success rate, taking an average of 27 sessions till treatment over. Ellis did however say that it is not always effective due to patients lack of willingness to participate properly. Therapist competence also wildly effects outcome.\nX Individual differences, less suitable for those patients with high levels of stress, also some patients would simply rather vent to their therapist than be given deep cognitive tasks to complete regarding their condition.\n&#10003; Support for behavioural activation, Babyak, studied 156 depressed adults. Randomly assigned to 4 month excercise course, drug treatment or a combination of the two. 6 months after therapies, those who were on excercise course had significantly lower relapse rates than drug treatment\nX Alternative treatments, drug treatments are also incredibly effective at reducing depressive symptoms and require less cognitive strain from the client, they also save hospitals money since repeated therapy visits requires a lot more time and training than distributing medication out. However, drugs may only target symptoms and therefore may not be able to get to root cause of issue and properly cure the depression.","<b><u>The biological approach to explaining OCD</u></b>\n&#10003; Family and twin studies, Nestadt got 80 people with OCD, and 343 of their first-degree relatives and then got a control of 73 people without a mental ilness and got 300 of their first-degree relatives. Found that people with a OCD relative had a 5 times greater risk of having the illness at some point in their lives in comparison to the control goup.\n&#10003; Brain scan evidence, Menzies conducted MRI of OCD patients and also of their immediate family without OCD and a group of unrelated healthy people. OCD patients and their close relatives had reduced grey matter in their OFC, supports that anatomical differences can be inherited and are linked with OCD\nX Biological explanation faces competition with behavioural model, two-process model can be applied to OCD. Learnt fear of NS such as dirt leads to instead of avoidance a unrelated behaviour thats aim is to reduce the fear caused by the NS. Albucher reports that between 60-90% of adults with OCD improved when using systematic desensitisation.","<b><u>The biological approach to treating OCD</u></b>\n&#10003; Effectiveness, Soomro reviewed 17 studies using SSRIs to treat patients and found that they were more effective at reducing symptoms that placebos in a 3 month period. One issue though is that there is not data available for the long term effectiveness of SSRIs\n&#10003; Drug therapies are preferred, requires little effort and time from the user, cheaper for health service since they dont require as much monitoring as in therapy, cost less than psychological treatments.\nX Side effects, SSRIs can have serious side effects such as nausea, headache and insomnia, Tricyclics are used only if SSRIs not effective due to side effects such as hallucinations. Benzodiazepines can lead to aggressive behaviours and impairment to memory. Also a problem with addiction with BZs so limited to 4 weeks of treatment (Ashton)\nX Turner found publication bias towards studies that show the positive effects of antidepressants, exaggerating benefits and minimising drawbacks of the medication.

So if someone is implicitly racist they have an unconscious bias against certain groups but wouldn't be aware and so introspection can't be effectively used\n&#10003; Strengths of a scientific approach, Wundt's approach formed the basis of many other approaches, psychodynamic, behaviourism and cognitive approaches all used scientific method, with cognitive neuroscience following this strictly. So Wundt paved the way for many approaches used today\nX Limitations of scientific method. Some psychologists feel that psychology is not a science and that we should instead study humans ideographically, making use of more natural methods in the field since this is where humans exist. This forms the basis of the Humanistic approach. Some believe Wundt sent psychology down the wrong path that it is still yet to recover from.","<b><u>The behaviourist approach</u></b>\n&#10003; Classical conditioning has application in therapy, systematic desensitisation was based on this, aims at removing the learned anxious response, this is effective as well.\nX Seligman said that classical conditioning is only appropriate for some learning, Seligman used preparedness to explain it instead, animals are prepared to learn associations that are crucial for their survival such as smell of meat with presence of food but unprepared for learning that isnt crucial for survival such as bell associated with food. Harder to establish if not survival.\n&#10003; Operant conditioning is based on experimental work, Skinner relied on experimental method, using controlled conditions, Skinners box, able to more easily observe certain behaviours.

If similar looking model was exercising, ppt engaged in more exercise in following 24hr than if model was merely loitering or did not look similar to the ppt.\nX Problem establishing causality, Siegel and McCormick suggest that young people who possess deviant attitudes and values seek out similar peers, this means that their delinquency may not be a result of social learning but they may have already possessed these traits.\nX Demand characteristics of Banduras study, 'That was the doll we were meant to hit', suggests that children only acted aggressively since they thought thats what they were supposed to do, not because they wanted to imitate the models.","<b><u>The cognitive approach</u></b>\n&#10003; Uses scientific method, means that research is replicable increasing its validity\n&#10003; Effective treatments, this approach has been used to produce CBT which is an effective treatment for a number of mental disorders\nX Computer models cant be applied to humans, it assumes humans treat all information equally like computers do but humans place emotional value on certain memories, we are also not perfect in function like computers and are prone to things such as forgetting\n X Based on unrealistic research such as Baddeley, Peterson^2 and Jacobs, as such may lack ecological validity","<b><u>The biological approach</u></b>\n&#10003; Uses the scientific method, research conducted in highly controlled environments, objective findings\n&#10003; Applications for therapy, drug therapies used for a number of mental disorders, SSRIs are an antidepressant increase serotonin leading to more emotional stability, happiness and calmness\nX Reductionist, many explanations of mental disorders rely soley on the biological approach but this may miss other factors such as environmental factors.\nX Deterministic, suggests that if we have certain gene we are going to have a certain behaviour type such as MAOA gene defect means someone will be aggressive","<b><u>The psychodynamic approach</u></b>\nX Gender bias, much of Freuds research was focussed heavily on males and attempted to apply this research to women, this is an issue since his research is still widely referenced today but it contains androcentrism and alpha bias.\n&#10003; Explains behaviour with both nature and nurture, says that there is an innate factor with the Id and its impulsive demands however this behaviour is dependent on the Ego which mediates between the impulsive demands of the Id and the societal/culture expectations of external reality.\nX Deterministic, states that all of our behaviour is caused by unconscious factors that we have no control over\nX Lacks use of the scientific method, Freud stated that during the latency psychosexual stage, all previous stages are forgotten which means that his research is not falsifiable, also subjective","<b><u>Humanistic psychology</u></b>\n&#10003; Links to economic development, Hagerty looked at relationship between economic growth and measures of Maslows levels in 88 countries over 34 year period.

Used to much in modern society\nX Taylor suggested it suffers gender bias. Women tend and befriend instead of fight or flight. Involves protecting themselves and their young and forming protective alliances with other women. This is because these have evolved from women being the primary caregiver, fleeing may put their offspring in danger. Beta bias research.\nX Gray said that F/F is an incomplete explanation, it ignores the role of 'freeze' which is required for stopping and analysing danger, hypervigilance. Allows them to create a best response to particular threat.\nX Von Dawans challenged the idea of fight/flight and tend/befriend. He found that acute stress can actually lead to greater cooperative and friendly behaviours, in both men and women. Explains human connections in times of crisis (e.g. 9/11). We are fundamentally social animals and human social relationships have lead to our species thriving.","<b><u>Localisation of function</u></b>\n&#10003; Support from aphasia studies, Expressive aphasia is an impaired ability to produce language and is typically caused by damage to Broca's area. Receptive aphasia is an impaired ability to understand language, usually a result of damage to Wernickes area.\nX Equipotentiality theory by Lashley, believes that basic motor and sensory functions were localised but that higher mental functions arent. He claimed that intact areas of the cortext could take responsibilty for certain cognitive functions following damage to the original areas.\nX Dronkers, re-examined preserved brains of two of Broca's patients. Used MRI imaging, found that other areas may have contributed to the patients' speech deficits, suggests language and cognition are far more complicated rather than being localised to specific areas.\nX Communication may be more important than localisation, Wernicke claimed that although different regions of the brain had different specialist functions, they are interdependent since they must interact with each other. Suggests that impairments that are associated with a specific function may be due to the connection between two parts of the brain being damaged.","<b><u>Lateralisation and split-brain research</u></b>\n\n<b><u>Lateralisation</u></b>\n&#10003; Lateralisation has advantages, increasing neural capacity, Rogers supported this theory with chickens, lateralisation enables them to simultaneously search for food and look out for predators, suggests evolutionary advantage\nX Appears to have negative payoff, architecta and mathematicians tend to have superior RH functioning, they also tend to suffer from greater immune deficiencies. Supported by Mordit and Weekes, left handers had higher incidences of immune deficiencies within their immediate families\nX Lateralisation changes with age, lateralised patterns found in youth tend to switch to bilateral patterns in healthy older adults. Szaflarski found that language become more lateralised to the left hemisphere with increasing age, but after 25, lateralisation decreased with each decade of life\n\n<b><u>Split-brain research</u></b>\nX Language may not be restricted to the LH, case studies such as J.W who had a damaged LH demonstrated the ability for the RH to develop language functioning, to the extent that he can now speak out loud about information presented to him.\nX Limited sample size, they are rarely ever conducted nowadays, Andrewes claims that conclusions have been drawn from participants with a counfounding physical disorder, insufficient numbers","<b><u>Plasticity and functional recovery</u></b>\n\n<b><u>Plasticity</u></b>\n&#10003; Support from Kempermann animal studies.

Hippocampus showed most development since it is required for navigation.\n&#10003; Maguire, The Knowledge, 320 basic routes, 25,000 streets in those basic routes, found that these drivers had a significantly larger posterior hippocampus that control group members. The size was also positively correlated with the experience of the drivers.\n\n<b><u>Functional recovery</u></b>\n&#10003; Tajiri, brain damaged rats, injected group 1 with stem cells into damaged area, group 2 injected with saline solution. Group 1 saw increase in activity in damaged area suggesting stem cells helped functional recovery, group 2 had no change\nX Age differences, Huttenlocher found that functional recovery decreased in efficiency with age. Suggests the only solution to damage in older patients is compensatory strategies (learning new/different ways of completing tasks)\nX Schneider, functional recovery may be linked to educational attainment. Brain damaged patients with college education or equivalent were 7x more likely to recover than patients who didnt finish high school. May be due to higher educated people using brain more often, meaning it repairs more effectively.","<b><u>Ways of studying the brain</u></b>\n<b>Postmortem</b>\n✓ Allows for a more detailed examination of the brain that arent possible with scanning techniques, deeper regions such as hypothalamus and hippocampus\nX The approach is retrospective, patient is already dead. This means researcher cant follow up on any abnormalities they find and instead have to rely on documented behaviours, difficult to establish connection between physical abnormalities and cognitive functioning\nX People die in variety of different circumstances, and at different stages of diseases which massively influences postmortem research. Drug treatments, time between death and postmortem are all confounding variables that may alter the research in different ways\n✓ Harrison said that postmortems have played a large part in our understanding of schizophrenia, researchers discovered structural abnormalities and found evidence of changes in neurotransmitter systems (both associated with the disorder)\n\n<b>fMRI</b>\n✓ Non-invasive, doesnt involve insertion of instruments into brain, nor does it expose to harmful radiation unlike some other scanning techniques\n✓ Offers an objective and reliable measure of psychological processes than possible with verbal reports\nX Measures changes in blood flow so isnt a direct measure of neural activity, therefore not a truly quantitative measure of mental activity\nX Critics argue that it ignores the network nature of the brain and instead focuses on localisation of function so it is unable to get a deep understanding of cognitive processes\n\n<b>Electroencephalogram</b>\n✓ Shows real time brain activity, not a still-image\n✓ Useful for clinical diagnosis, records can be compared with EEGs of people with certain disorders\nX Only focuses on superficial regions of the brain, cant see whats going on in deeper areas\nX Electrical activity may be picked up from neighbouring electrodes and interfere with accuracy\n\n<b>ERPs</b>\nX Needs lots of repetitions and trials before useful data can be extracted\n✓ Allows us to see how brain processing is affected by specific manipulations\n\nIf 16 mark comparison question, regular AO1 and around 5-6 mini AO3 comparison paragraphs","<b><u>Circadian rhythms</u></b>\n✓ Hughes, support for the importance of light, tested circadian rhythm hormone release in 4 ppts stationed in Antartica.

Then followed by 3 weeks of darkness, and cortisol levels now peaked at noon, showing light effects circadian rhythms\nX Individual differences, Czeisler found that circadian rhythms vary from 13-65 hrs. Duffy found that peak stages of each cycle vary for different people, there are 'larks', morning people, and 'owls', late people. Suggests this approach is reductionist\nX Issues with methodology, early research utilised artifical lights assuming it wouldnt have an effect on circadian rhythms. However Czeisler used artifical lights was able to alter ppts circadian rhythms significantly, suggests early research may have not been valid\n✓ Chronotherapeutics, RWA, timing can affect drug impact. Heart attack medication is more beneficial in the morning since this is when heart attacks are most likely to occur. New administering systems have therefore been developed to make use of circadian rhythms to make sure drugs are active when they are most needed.","<b><u>Ultradian and infradian rhythms</u></b>\n\n<b>Infradian rhythms</b>\n✓ Russel noted the McClintock effect - that women of childbearing age all living in close proximity and not using oral contraceptives often find that their cycles align. Tested this by taking sweat form one woman and applying it to the lips of a group of women. Found that their cycles aligned. The EPs that cause the menstrual cycle appear to come off as pheremones and act as EZs for other women's cycles.\n✓ Support for impact of menstrual cycle on mate choice, Penton-Voak, found that women typically prefer a more masculine face when they are at their most fertile since it typically means the man has 'good genes' and better for reproduction. For longer term relationships they seek out 'kind' more feminine faces of men.\n✓ Miller found that men are more likely to find women more attractive when they are at their most fertile stage of their cycle. Lap dancing club, women were tested in their most fertile stages and earned almost twice as much tips as women who werent. May have been due to pheremones releasing or women feeling more attractive so dancing more attractively.\n\n<b>Ultradian rhythms</b>\nX Tucker studied ppts over 11 consecutive days and nights in a controlled setting.

Since environment is controlled, suggests a biological factor rather than environmental\nX Ohayon, meta analysis of 65 studies on lifespan changes in sleep, ppts aged 5-102 years old. Total time asleep decreased over lifespan, from 470 mins a night at 5 yrs old to 370mins at 70yrs. Older people also got less deep sleep and less REM sleep","<b><u>Endogenous pacemakers and exogenous zeitgebers</u></b>\n✓ The role of the SCN, Morgan bred a strain of hamsters to have an abnormal circadian rhythm of 20hrs instead of 24hrs. He then transplanted the SCN of the abnormal hamsters to the normal hamsters, found that their circadian rhythm adjusted to 20hrs, did the reverse and found the abnormal hamsters adjusted to 24hrs.\nX Adverse effects on health. Touitou conducted research that found teenagers spend increasing amounts of time on LED screens at night which keeps the circadian clock active. Leads to suppression of melatonin secretion meaning they dont feel tired and dont sleep. As a result their sleep becomes shortened, irregular and delayed. Leads to increased mood disorders.\n✓ EPs override EZs, Folkard, 12ppts in a cave, no EZs except 24hr clock, told to rise at 7:45 and sleep at 23:45 (clock rigged to run 2hrs fast). 11/12 ppts struggled - EPs resisted the rapid changes, if changes are too severe, EPs will override EZs.\n✓ Stephen and Zucker found that SCN is vital for regulation of biorhythms, damaged the SCNs of rats, prior to this damage the rats had set biorhythms. Damage to SCN resulted in biorhythms desynchronising - still eat and slept but were active at random times."],

As such, women may be disadvantaged due to beta bias\n✓ Reverse alpha bias, introducing theories that emphasis the value of women can be beneficial, Cornwell found that women are better at learning as they are more attentive and organised. This can help change preconceptions and challenge the male position being superior\n✓ Femenist psychology, Gilligan, acknowledges there are real biologically based sex differences but states that socially determined stereotypes exaggerate these. One way to combat this is to provide women with greater support. Eagly claims that women are less effective leaders, but this information should be used to help women and developing programmes. This feminist way of thinking can enable a greater equality.","<b><u>Culture bias</u></b>\nX Bias in research methods, Smith and Bond, analysed the research in a European psychology textbook, 66% of studies American, 32% European and 2% from rest of world, unrepresentitive on global scale\n✓ Idigenous psychologies, Afrocentrism is a movement that states black people have roots in Africa and hence psychological theories around such people should be African centred. Disputes the idea that values of European people are an accurate, universal depiction of behaviour\nX Consequences of cultural bias, Gould conducted a US Army IQ test. The test showed white Americans scored the highest and that African Americans scored the lowest, leading to negative attitudes towards black individuals at the time. White Americans were elitist as a result\n✓ The worldwide psychological community, nowadays more and more research is being conducted in places where it previously had not taken place (due to ease of travel).

They are both necessary and without one of them, behaviour cannot be fully explained, highlighting the importance of an interactionist approach.\n✓ Diathesis stress model, suggests there may be a biological predisposition to a certain behaviour or disorder such as schizophrenia. However it may require certain stressful events to occur in order to trigger the condition, nature is only expressed under certain conditions of nurture.\n✓ Nature affects nurture, Plomin discovered a <i>reactive</i> gene in children that has an influence on their upbringing, it essentially means that the child is a nuisance and that this affects how they are raised, in turn affecting their development.\n✓ Nurture affects nature, Maguire, taxi drivers, brains changed over time due to experience driving, hippocampus grew larger than control group","<b><u>Holism and reductionism</u></b>\n✓ Biological reductionism, drug therapies can be devised from this reductionism\nX Environmental reductionism, non human research\nX Experimental research, may not accurately represent everyday life, lacks mundane realism\nX Dangers of lower levels of explanation, meaning of behaviour may be overlooked, Wolpe - found woman had phobia of insects, root cause was her husband had an insect nicknames as she was having issues with him.","<b><u>Idiographic and nomothetic approaches</u></b>\n✓ Strength of focussing on the individual, nomothethic loses sight of what it means to be human, Allport argued that it is only by knowing the person as an individual can we predict what they will do in certain situations\n✓ Scientific basis, idiographic approach lacks objective evidence through humanistic approach, however other idiographic approaches do use evidence-based research, case studies or qualitative research\nX Unable to make general predictions with the idiographic approach unlike the nomothetic approach, drug treatments require general predictions to be made so that they can be created. Suggests nomothetic better than idiographic for developing psychological treatments.\nX Time consuming, the idiographic approach takes a lot of time collecting data about one individual, whilst the nomothetic approach spends time gathering data about a large group of individuals. This means that the idiographic approach is less efficient when it comes to collecting data and the data may not even be of much value.","<b><u>Ethical implications of research</u></b>\nX Wider impact of research, indirect impact on participants family or the group they represent, researchers therefore need to think beyond simply the safeguarding of the individual themselves\nX The inadequacy of the current ethical guidelines, still means that research could inflict harm on a group within a society, e.g. currently the guidelines dont ask researchers to consider how the findings may be used by others\nX May disadvantage marginalised groups, fails to include certain groups within research meaning they may miss out on possible benefits from the research, also unecessarily limits our understanding of human behaviour\nX Simply avoiding socially sensitive research, the argument in favour of this being that it could otherwise lead to negative consequences for certain groups. Sieber and Stanley said that ignoring sensitive research is not a responsible approach, also an avoidance of responsibility, therefore psychologists have a duty to conduct such research otherwise they are left with unimportant issues to study"],
    ["aggression","<b><u>Neural and hormonal influences</u></b>\n✓ Research into drugs that increase serotonin, Berman gave participants paroxetine (an SSRI) or placebo, lab based shock game then took place, people who took paroxetine gave fewer and less intense shocks\nX Issues with limbic system, non limbic areas affect aggression, limited explanation by saying aggression is down to limbic system, OFC - impulse regulation and inhibition of aggressive behaviours\n✓ Giammanco, removed the testes of male monkeys and found that it resulted in less aggressive behaviour, confirming role of testosterone\n✓ Gospic found increased amygdala activity in a game where participants have to decide how to split money with a confederate, supports the role of the amygdala in aggression","<b><u>Genetic factors in aggression</u></b>\nX Difficult to separate genetic and environmental factors, McDermott showed that participants with a low activity MAOA gene did behave aggressively in a lab based game but only if they were provoked. Otherwise they were no more aggressive than the other participants, shows environmental conditions must be suitable\n✓ Godar, support from animal studies. Genetic deletion is a technique that allows experimentors to remove single genes from mice. Godar showed that mice with a removed MAOA gene have reduced serotonin reuptake and were hyper aggressive. (however cant be applied to humans accurately)\nX A limitation of the MAOA explanation is that there could be multiple genes that influence aggressive behaviour. Stuart found that intimate partner violence in men was associated with the serotonin transporter gene as well as the MAOA gene, only the combination of the two that led to such behaviour.\n✓ Mertins, support for MAOA, when the MAOA gene activity levels are <u>higher</u> than normal, this leads to prosocial behaviour. Individuals with higher activity were more compassionate in a money-lending game, suggests the link is valid due to correlations in both directions matching the explanation.","<b><u>The ethological explanation</u></b>\nX Tinbergens research is animal based, limited as an explanation for human behaviour, research was reliable however and can be used to show IRMs and FAPs in nature\nX Goodall, observed a 'four year war' between two communities of male chimps. In this war one community killed all members of the other group. Systematic and incredibly violent methods, continued even when appeasment signal was shown. Challenges ethological views about same species aggression (ritualistic aggression)\nX FAPs are not fixed, Hunt pointed out that FAPs are actually greatly influenced by environmental factors and learning experiences. Duration of each behaviour varies per individual in a species. Patterns of aggressive behaviour are therefore much more flexible than first proposed by Lea\n✓ There is however support from the idea that aggression is genetic and evolution based, Brunner - Dutch family, twin and adoption studies","<b><u>Evolutionary explanations of human aggression</u></b>\nX Culture bias with Wilson and Daly's research, makes no mention of any cultures, focuses only on individualistic strategies\nX Doesn't explain all aggression, cant account for large scale atrocities such as genocides with this explanation\nX Gender bias, doesnt offer up an explanation for female aggression, states that men use mate retention strategies which leads to aggression but doesn't explain female aggression\nX Aggressive behaviours may not always be adaptive, violent males may be rejected as mates and warriors may die in battle. Aggression can therefore be considered more maladaptive in certain cases. However, Duntley and Buss point out that benefits of aggression have outweighed costs on average, relative to other strategies in the past","<b><u>The frustration-aggression hypothesis</u></b>\nX Many of Dollards claims have no evidence to back them up, Bushman suggested that instead its acting aggressively that is more likely to lead to further aggression later on\nX Aggression isnt an automatic response to frustration, social learning theorists claim that it may be through vicarious reinforcement of watching models be successful through aggressive behaviour that leads to such behaviour\nX Frustation isnt the only cause of aggression, Reifman reviewed a baseball game and discovered that temperature rises lead to higher aggression among players, measured in how hard/aggressively the ball was thrown and hit\nX Overly deterministic, suggests individuals cant act on their own accord and that if a frustrating stimulus is present then aggression must occur","<b><u>Social learning theory</u></b>\n✓ Poulin and Boivin, applied social learning theory behaviour to boys aged 9-12. Found that most aggressive boys formed friendships with other aggressive boys. They are frequently exposed to models of physical aggression (each other) and they have positive reinforcement, ensuring they engage in such activities\nX On the other hand, SLT is unable to explain all types of aggression. There are two types: Reactive and Proactive. Children with experience with proactive aggression, typically have high self-efficacy, confidence that the behaviour will benefit them. However reactively aggressive children use aggression to retaliate in the heat of the moment.\n✓ Real life application, Huesmann and Eron found that media influence of aggression can be powerful influences on a childs behaviour. If a character is rewarded for aggressive behaviour in a video game or on tv show and the child is able to identify with this character then vicarious reinforcement occurs and the child may exhibit aggressive behaviour.\nX Cultural differences, different cultures have different norms about which behaviour should be reinforced. The Kung San people, reinforcement of aggressive behaviour on children is unlikely since parents tend not to use it to discipline children. However, even though aggression is unavailable for children to see, they still exhibit this behaviour so it suggests SLT is limited in explanation.","<b><u>De-individuation theory</u></b>\n✓ Douglas and McGarty, looked at aggressive online behaviour in chatrooms and found a strong correlation between sending hostile or aggressive messages and anonymity\nX Gergen, 'Deviance in the dark', participants divided into groups of 8 and put into a completely darkened room for 1 hour, told they could do whatever they wanted. Told it would be impossible to identify each other after the study and wouldnt meet the people from the room again. Did not take long for intimate behaviour to initiate\n✓ Johnson and Downing, found that participants dressed in KKK uniforms were more aggressive and delivered higher-intensity electric shocks to confederates compared to those dressed as nurses whom were more compassionate to the confederates.\n✓ Real world evidence, online gaming platforms such as PSN and Xbox live is prone to aggressive behaviour since it promotes anonymity and de-individuation among players.","<b><u>Institutional aggression in prisons</u></b>\nX Camp and Gaes, studied 561 male inmates with similar criminal histories and predispositions to aggression. Half placed in low security prisons, the other half in high. Found similar levels of aggressive misconduct over 2 years between prisons suggesting dispositional factor rather than the prison environment.\nX An interactionist approach may be more appropriate, Dobbs and Waid argue in favour of an interactionist model since inmates first entering prison may experience the deprivaion but it doesnt necessarily lead to violence unless combined with the imported characteristics of the inmates themselves\n✓ Dilulio claims the importation model is an inadequate explanation of aggressive behaviour, ignores roles of prison officials and factors relating to the running of prisons which all affect behaviours of inmates, poorly run prisons appear to show more aggression among inmates\n✓ Cunningham analysed 25 inmate homicides in Texas prisons and found the reasonings behind them lined up with what Clemmer first identified as part of the deprivation model, drugs, homosexual relations and personal possessions","<b><u>Media influences on aggression</u></b>\nX May be game difficulty rather than game content, Przybylski, suggests that a players anger is derived from their frustration at failure rather than violent storyline in a game, which therefore links back to Dollards frustration-aggression hypothesis as a more appropriate explanation\nX Measurements of aggression are often unrealistic in many studies, they are things such as Taylor Competitive Reaction Time Task which cant accurately represent aggression in the real world, contrary to this longitudinal studies can measure this with criminal records but there is a limitation with time it takes to collect that data\nX DeLisi, study, issues with methodology and structured interview, likely involved leading questions that results in desired response from individuals and also correlation isnt causation, may be extraneous variable that is ignored\n✓ Andersons meta-analysis included a variety of different methodologies which ensures the data collected is likely to be accurate, also included a large number of studies, 136, increasing validity of analysis","<b><u>Explanations of media influences</u></b>\n✓ Desensitisation, Krahé showed participants violent and non-violent film clips while measuring physiological arousal, participants who were habitual viewers of violent media showed lower levels of arousal when watching these clips\n✓ Disinhibition, Berkowitz and Alioto, found that participants who saw a film depicting aggression as vengance gave more (fake) electrical shocks of a longer duration to a confederate, suggests media violence may increase aggressive behaviour when the aggression is justified in the media, seen as socially acceptable\n✓ Cartoon violence, most children understand that it is not possible to punch someone so hard that their eyes burst out their sockets like in certain cartoons. However, children witness that aggressive behaviours arent punished and therefore prepare their own cognitive script for how aggressive situations occur, through the process of cognitive priming, about what is socially acceptable\nX Desensitisation, catharsis, viewing violent behaviour acts as a safety mechanism allowing people to release aggressive impulses without the need to behave violently"],
    ["schizophrenia","<b><u>Reliability and validity in classification and diagnosis</u></b>\n\n<b>Co-morbidity</b>\nSupport for this issue comes from suicide rates. SZs have a 1% chance of attempting suicice however this number quickly jumps to 40-45% if depression is co-morbid. 10-15% succeed. This demonstrates the issue of co-morbidity, highlights major safety issues to the patients if a misdiagnosis occurs. Weber found correlations between SZ and physical secondary disorders such as type 2 diabetes, asthma and hypertension. Therefore, co-morbidity is a serious issue when diagnosing schizophrenia\n\n<b>Culture bias</b>\nSupport for culture bias being an issue comes from Harrison. Found that African-Caribbean populations in the USA had an eight times greater diagnosis rate for SZ than equivalent Caucasian populations. May be due to mental health being based on Western concepts, making an incorrect diagnosis more likely. Shows clear difference in how people from different cultures are diagnosed.\n\n<b>Symptom overlap</b>\nSupport for the issue of symptom overlap comes from Swets. Found that 12% of SZ patients also met criteria for a diagnosis of OCD, whilst 25% displayed significant OCD symptoms, despite the low prevelance of both disorders in society. This supports the issue with symptom overlap since it demonstrates a lack of clarity when classifying between two very distinct disorders\n\n<b>Gender bias</b>\nSupport for this issue comes from Loring and Powell; gave psychiatrists vignettes of patients and found higher diagnosis rates when they believed the patient to be male. Also made the assumption on gender neutral cases that the patient was male. However no significant gender bias among female clinicians, supporting the idea that gender bias is rooted in both patient gender and clinician gender","<b><u>Biological explanations of schizophrenia</u></b>\n\n<b><u>Genetic Factors</u></b>\nX Twin studies and family studies doesn't separate nature/nurture, could just be due to being raised in schizophrenic household\nX Sz may develop in adoptive scenarios since the family are aware that the childs parents have schizophrenia, this may lead to a self-fulfulling prophecy whereby they raise the infants in a way that actually may lead to the development of Sz\nX In Tienaris research, there were higher rates in the non-sz adoptions than that of the general population, could suggest that it may have something to do with being adopted rather than a biological factor\n\n<b><u>Neural correlates</u></b>\n✓ Leucht, support for antipsychotic drugs, meta-analysis - 212 studies, all antipsychotic were more effective at reducing positive symptoms than placebos, all worked by normalising dopamine levels\n✓ Seeman, post mortem on Sz, found 2x the amount D₂ receptors sites on Sz as control group\nx2 However Szs may have received antipsychotic which can change brains physiological structure such as increasing D₂ receptor sites\nX Biologically reductionist, ignores environmental/social factors","<b><u>Biological treatments for schizophrenia</u></b>\n✓ Leucht, effectiveness, conducted a meta-analysis of 65 studies, patients with antipsychotic then some were switched to a placebo. Within a year, 64% placebo group relapsed; only 27% relapse rate of those who stayed on drugs, hence more effective than placebo\nx2 Ethical issues with this research, obviously certain patients were removed from their successful medication for this research to occur, which lead to a significant increase in their likelihood of relapse, very unethical since the patients themselves are not of sound mind to consent and doing this without their knowledge may lead to serious effects on their mental health\nX Side effects, can induce minor side effects: drowsiness, changes in weight, visual disturbances etc. However can lead to more serious issues such as depression. Extrapyramidal side effects are severe, more than 50% of patients on antipsychotics experience Parkinsons like symptoms. Also tardive dyskensia, uncontrollable jaw movements. These side effects lead to revolving door phenomenom.\n✓ Crossley evaluted the differences between typical and atypical antipsychotics, found that there were no significant differences between the drugs in terms of effectiveness. However typical antipsychotics lead to more extrapyramidal side effects whereas atypical lead to more weight gain. As such, it is preferable for patients to use atypical due to reduced severity of side effects.\nX Drugs can lead to motivational deficits, meaning that if a patient is prescribed this medication, it reinforces the view that there is something wrong with THEM. This means that it may prevent the individual from seeing other possible stressors that are leading to the disorder and so they do not try to do anything to alleviate such stress. Hence reducing motivation.\nX Ethics with fully informed consent of receiving treatment in the first place. If negative side effects occur, there are issues regarding the wellbeing and rights of the Sz that need to be considered prior to applying the drugs. Cost-benefit analysis needs to occur for each case.","<b><u>Psychological explanations for schizophrenia</u></b>\n✓ Support from Sarin and Wallin. Found SZs with delusions had biases in their processing, jumped to conclusions, didnt reality test and found that they had impaired self monitoring and would experience their own thoughts as voices.\n✓ Cognitive therapies are successful, CBTp involves patients evaluating content of their delusions/hallucinations and thinking about how to reality test them. Can reduce symptom severity and improve social functioning\nX Ignores other factors such as social adversity, Howes and Murray devised an integrated model: suggests if early issues are paired with social stressors then it sensitises the dopamine system, leads to more dopamine, faulty cognitive functioning leads to delusions/hallucinations. Leads to psychosis which loops back to start\n\n<b><u>Family dysfunction</u></b>\n<b><u>Double bind</u></b>\n✓ Support from Berger, SZ patients reported higher levels of double bind statements at home. This may not be reliable however since they are schizophrenic\nX Lots of opposition, Liem found no difference in parental communication in SZ an non SZ families, although results may have been subjected to demand characterstics\nX Hall and Levin further opposition, studied data from various studies, finding no differences between families with and without a SZ member and the amount of double bind present\n\n<b><u>Expressed emotion</u></b>\nX Causality, in an issue - is EE a cause or effect of SZ. Could it be that the parent becomes high EE due to their childs schizophrenia\nX Cant explain all SZs, many patients in high EE families dont relapse, while many who are in low EE families do relapse, another factor at play\n✓ Has lead to an effective therapy, family therapy, teaching family members to reduce their EE they show in order to better support their SZ family member","<b><u>CBTp</u></b>\n✓ Advantages, of CBTp over standard care, NICE review of treatments for schizophrenia found evidence that compared to antipsychotic meds alone, CBTp was more effective in reducing rehospitalisation rates up to 18 months following end of treatment. Was also better at reducing symptom severity\nX However, there is a lack of availability of CBTp, despite being recommended by NICE as a treatment, only 1 in 10 SZs are estimated to get offered this treatment and of those limited who are offered, a large portion reject or dont show up\nX The benefits of CBTp may have been overstated, a meta-analysis found that effectiveness may actually be lower than originally thought, revealed that it has only a small therapeutic effect on key symptoms, however these benefits disappeared when assessed blind\nx2 issues with SZ meta-analysis', failed to randomly allocate, failed to mask treatment conditions\nX Effectiveness is dependent on the stage of the disorder, CBTp appears to be more effective when it is made available at specific stages of the disorder, and when the delivery of CBTp is made to match the stage of the patients' disorder. Research shown that those with more awareness of their SZ benefit more from CBTp than others","<b><u>Family therapy</u></b>\nX Effectiveness is still down to drugs, all family therapy does is increase compliance to drugs and this is what prevents the patients from relapsing, hence it is simply an expensive way of ensuring patients take medication\nX Studies have issues over validity, observer bias - those judging improvements werent 'blinded' to conditions in a number of Pharoahs studies, also a large portion of studies were from China, whom have a habbit of not using random allocation in research\nX Garety said that relapse rates in SZs using family therapy are no higher than those who simply have a trained carer, often low in EE suggesting family therapy may nor be worth the time and money over simply having a high quality standard care\n✓ Economic benefits, cost of family therapy is quickly offset by longterm financial benefits, means that patient doesnt experience revolving door phenomenom, nor do they require a hospital stay to be payed for them","<b><u>Token economy</u></b>\n✓ Dickerson, meta-analysis of 13 studies in institutional settings, 11 reported benefits directly attributed to token economy, however there may be issues with the methodological validity of this research\nX Hard to assess success, when token economy is introduced, it is introduced using all patients, therefore there is no control group to compare effectivenes to, only to past behaviours, making such tests retrospective\nX Doesnt work in the community, when in institutions, token economies can be applied relatively easily, since they control what the patients get access to. However, in the real world, this would not be appropriate to use due to it being hard to apply and maintain. Therefore, doesnt work at main job of getting schizophrenics to function in the real world\nX Ethical issues, this could be considered manipulation, making human beings earn privilages such as visits, TV time and nicer foods. Why are the patients witheld from such privilages normally, they should have access to such benefits normally","<b><u>Interactionist approach</u></b>\n✓ Diathesis may not just be genetic: Verdoux identified birth complications as leading to increased risk of SZ - could be due to oxygen deprivation\nX hard to identify trigger of SZ, trigger doesnt occur immediately, could be longer term and manifest over years e.g. childhood trauma, could lead to ineffective coping strategies which gradually trigger SZ, hard to spot trigger so hard to act to prevent it\nX Urban environments may not be more stressful: other studies have found no connection between population density and SZ. Could be due to socioeconomic status instead, poorer people living in urbanized areas\nX Implications for treatment, improve knowledge of genetic causes of Sz and how they interact with the environmental triggers, means preventitive methods can be applied"],
    ["relationships","<b><u>Sexual selection and human reproductive behaviour</u></b>\n✓ Buss, survey of over 10,000 adults in 33 countries, asked questions pertaining to age and a variety of attributes that evolutionary theory says should be important. Found that women placed greater value on resource-related characteristics and males values good looks and chastity more\n✓ Clark and Hatfield, support for men and intra-sexual selection (quantity over quality), psychology students asked to go around university campus and ask members of the opposite sex to sleep with them as they found them attractive. No females agreed whereas 75% of males did agree.\nX This theory lacks temporal validity, is dependent on men going to work however nowadays women are getting more roles in the workplaces meaning they dont need a man to provide these resources for them. Social changes have adjusted womens preferences meaning the theory may no longer be applicable\n✓ Many female body types that males prefer can be empirically tested. Singh studied waist to hip ratio, found that men preferred if a woman had a WHR of around 0.7:1. This is because it is seen as a 'honest signal' of fertility (hard to fake) and it shows that they arent currently pregnant","<b><u>Factors affecting attraction #1: Self-disclosure</u></b>\n✓ Sprecher and Henrick, studied heterosexual couples dating, found strong correlations between several measures of satisfaction and self-disclosure. More satisfied in relationships. Less intimate couples also self-disclosed less often.\n✓ Hass and Stafford, found 57% of gay men and women said that honest self-disclosure was the main way they maintained and deepened their committed relationships. Intimacy can be improved by simply increasing the amount of self-disclosure, typically shy people who resorted normally to small talk, when implementing self-disclosure lead to more benefits\nX Self-disclosing may not be an explanation for all cultures, Tang found that men and women self-disclosed a lot more sexual thoughts and feelings in individualist cultures (USA) as opposed to collectivist cultures such as China. Both levels of self-disclosure were associated with satisfaction in relationships within each culture\nX Issues regarding self-disclosure is that it states that the more deep and intimate and intense self-disclosure is regarding feelings and emotions, the better the relationship will be. However, often times when couples are trying to salvage a dying relationship they will resort to such measures however it is rarely enough to save the relationship","<b><u>Factors affecting attraction #2: Physical attractiveness</u></b>\n✓ Palmer and Peterson, found physically attractive people were rated as more politically knowledgeable and competent than unattractive people. Therefore the halo effect has real life implications when it comes to democracy and voting.\nX Some people simply dont place much value on physical attractiveness, Towhey asked male and female participants to rate how much they would like a target individual based on their photograph and some biographical information. Also completed MACHO test, evaluates an individuals sexist attitudes. Found if rated higher on MACHO scale, cared more about looks\n✓ Feingold, carried out a meta-analysis of 17 studies and found a significant correlation in ratings of attractiveness between romantic partners, showing that people find their partners attractive since it is the best they could achieve in terms of looks yet are still satisfied since they are aware they match relatively well.\nX Taylor found that the matching hypothesis did not apply for online relationships, looked at activity logs of popular online dating sites. Many people on these sites were attempting to match with individuals who were more physically attractive that themselves, it seems they did not consider their own attractiveness when making decisions","<b><u>Factors affecting attraction #3: Filter theory</u></b>\n✓ Filter theory agrees with many peoples views that relationships change over time which means that it has face validity, Winch found evidence that similarities in personality, interests and attitudes are typical for early stages of relationships. Also Winch found that complementarity is important for couples whom have been married for several years\nX Levinger pointed out that many studies actually failed to replicate the original findings that form the basis for filter theory. He put this down to social changes over time. It is also hard to establish a depth for a relationship, relationships develop at different rates, some people may be much close before 18 months than other couples at 18 months so its hard to evaluate properly.\nX Filter theory suggests couples are initally similar which is what attract them to each other however Anderson found that, in a longitudinal study of cohabiting partners, similarities between couples actually grow over time when they are together, a phenomenom called emotional convergence. This challenges the theory by providing evidence that the exact opposite actually occurs\nX Filter theory is now limited due to rises in technology, online dating applications allow users to match with people whom they would never typically see or meet with in their regular life. These people may be outside of their social class or simply be far away but now proximity doesnt matter as much due to messaging and video calls. Theory lacks temporal validity","<b><u>Theories of relationships #1: Social exchange theory</u></b>\nX Clark and Mills challenged SET by rejecting the economic basis of the theory. The theory proposes that individuals keep track of rewards and costs however if this were true, couples would notice this behaviour in each other and question the sort of relationship that the other person wants to have\nX SET claims that we become dissatisfied in a relationship either when the costs outweigh the rewards or when an alternative option becomes available and it is better than your current one. However, as Argyle pointed out, this suggests partners are constantly searching for new, better alternatives to the current relationship, looking at other attractive people, but we dont actually do this. We only evaluate others' attractiveness WHEN we become dissatisfied\nX SET has a central concern of the comparison level but this focus ignores a crucial factor, that being fairness within a relationship. Equity theory may propose a better theory for relationships since it considers more fairness between partners and this view is more important than the balance of rewards and costs.\nX SET deals with concepts that are difficult to quantify and therefore difficult to measure. While certain things can be considered through physical costs and reward such as money, there are many psychological costs and rewards that are difficult for partners to properly measure and also comparison levels vary from person to person so its unclear on the tipping point for alternatives","<b><u>Theories of relationships #2: Equity theory</u></b>\n✓ Utne carried out a survey of 118 recently married couples and measured equity with self-report scales. They had been together 2 years before marrying, found that couples who considered themselves equitable were more satisfied than those who felt they were under or over benefiting\nX Cultural differences, couples from individualistic cultures considered their relationship most satisfying when it was equitable, whereas collectivist felt most satisfied when they were overbenefiting. True for both men and women.\nX Individual differences, Huesman, suggest some people are less sensitive to equity than others, some people are 'benevolents' and are more willing to contribute more to a relationship than they get out of it. There are also 'entitleds' who believe they deserve to be overbenefiting without any guilt\nX Berg and McQuinn found that contrary to Equity theory, equity doesnt develop over time, it is simply either there to begin with, or it isnt there at all and this continues throughout the relationship. Based on a longitudinal study on 38 couples dating","<b><u>Theories of relationships #3: Rusbult's Investment Model</u></b>\n✓ Le and Agnew, meta-analysis of 52 studies including 11,000 ppts across 5 countries. Found that satisfaction, comparison level with alternatives and investment size could all predict relationship commitment, lead to most stable and long lasting relationships, true for men, women, all cultures in the study, heterosexual and homosexual couples\n✓ Support for explanation for intimate partner violence, explains why people do not simply leave abusive relationships. Rusbult and Martz studied women in abusive relationships at a shelter and found that those most likely to return to their abusive partners (most committed) reported having put in a great investment and also having fewer attractive alternatives\nX Goodfriend and Agnew stated that Rusbults original theory is limited in that it doesnt explain investments properly, early relationships dont have investments yet still continue to grow and develop. This is because investments also include future plans, which better explains why early on couples maintain their relationships\nX Research is correlational, doesnt show that the factors are a cause of commitment but just that they occur alongside commitment. It could actually be that the more committed you feel to your partner, the more you are willing to invest, so the direction of causality may actually be reversed","<b><u>Theories of relationships #4: Ducks Phase Model</u></b>\nX Rollie and Duck said that the original model is actually oversimplified and that there is a fith stage, the resurrection phase. Ex-partners turn attention to future relationships using the knowledge gained from the one that just recently ended. Also now made it clear that the progression from one stage to the next is not inevitable, can also jump back to a previous phase\nX Retrospective research, considering there is most likely a considerable amount of time after the relationship is over from the early stages of the breakdown, may mix ideas together or simply ignore certain details. Almost impossible to study the first stage of breakdown\n✓ Model is useful as it notes that repair strategies are more effective at certain stages of the relationships breakdown, for example Duck recommends people in the intra-psychic stage start to try and focus on positive aspects of their partners and in the dyadic stage they should focus on communication\nX One issue is that Ducks model doesnt focus on <i>why</i> relationships breakdown, only the stages that occur after. Flemlee suggested the fatal attraction hypothesis. The cause of the relationships breakdown can be found in what originally brought them together. Relationship threatened by partners getting too much of what they were looking for, 'fantastic sense of humour' turns into 'cant take me seriously'","<b><u>Virtual relationships in social media</u></b>\nX The reduced cues theory is incorrect to assume that cues are entirely missing in CMC, likely that they are different rather than absent. Walther and Tidwell point out that people convey certain emotions through style and timing which act as cues for the other person. Other cues are things such as emoticons\n✓ Support that the hyperpersonal model leads to more self-disclosure, Whitty and Joinson found that questions asked in online discussions are typically very direct, probing and intimate. As such the responses they get are much deeper than what would be received in FTF conversations since those sorts of questions are not likely to be asked\nX Self-disclosure online is very dependent on the type of CMC being used, in the case of social networking sites, those people who converse online typically have an offline relationship as well, there are also things such as video calls which eliminates the issue of reduced cues\n✓ McKenna and Bargh found that people are better able to express their 'true selves' when using CMC instead of FTF. Of the romantic relationships formed online, 70% survived more than 2 years in comparison to 49% of those formed offline","<b><u>Parasocial relationships</u></b>\n✓ Maltby looked at the link between body image and celebrity worship in males and females aged 14-16. Females reported having an intense-personal parasocial relationship with a female celebrity whose body type was admired. These females tended to have poor body image and there may be a link with eating disorders\nX McCutcheon, measured attachment types and celebrity-related attitudes in 299 ppts. Found that people with insecure attachment types were <b>not</b> more likely to form parasocial relationships with celebrities compared to securely attached people.\nX The model is a better description of parasocial relationships as opposed to an explanation, it simply outlines the behaviours that occur following the starting of a parasocial relationship\n✓ Schmid and Klimmt found no cultural variations in parasocial relationships, conducted an online questionnaire and found similar levels of parasocial relationships with Harry Potter in Germany (individualistic) and Mexico (collectivist)"]
