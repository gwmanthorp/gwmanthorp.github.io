show majority that you are willing to suffer for your cause\n        5) Snowball effect - once some of the majority start to follow the minority this group slowly grows larger and larger spreading until it reaches a tipping point at which point it brings about wide spread change\n        <b>Social change through majority influence</b>\n        Social norms interventions - starts by identifying a widespread misperception, e.g. young people tend to misperceive the frequency and quantity of alcohol drunk by their peers and as such develop larger drinking habbits, correction campaigns are put in place to correct the misperception and communicating the _actual_ norm\n        <b>Example: 'Most of Us don't drink and drive</b>\n        Designed to reduce drink driving habbits among young adults in Montana, inital survey found that whilst 20.4% of young adults reported having driven within one hour of consuming two or more drinks in the previous month in Montana, 92% of respondants believed that the majority of their peers had done so, by simply correcting this misperception, the following month the drink driving was reduced to 13.7%"],
        
        ["attachments","<b><u>Caregiver-infant interactions:</u></b>\n<b>Reciprocity</b>\nJaffe conducted research that showed infants coordinate their actions into a kind of conversation with their caregivers, almost as if they were taking turns, Brazelton suggested the importance of this for later interactions where they need to anticipate behaviour correctly\n<b>Interactional Synchrony</b>\nMeltzoff and Moore observed a different kind of interaction they labelled interactional synchrony whereby infants as young as 2 and 3 weeks old imitated face and hand gestures conducted by an adult model\n<b>Real or psuedo-imitation</b>\nMeltzoff and Moore proposed that this imitation was deliberate. However, Jean Piaget claimed that true imitation only developed towards the end of the first year, instead the infant is 'rewarded', by the caregiver smiling, for replicating behaviour,(operant conditioning)\nBacked up by Murray and Trevarthan, live video of mother and the infant was not rewarded with a smile for copying behaviour and as such resulted in acute distress, gained no response to turned away","<b><u>The development of attachment</b></u>\n<b>Stages of attachment</b>\n<u>Stage 1: Indiscriminate attachments</u>\nFrom birth until about 2 months infants produce similar responses to all objects, inanimate or animate, starts prefering social stimuli towards the end of this period, reciprocity and interactional synchrony play an important part during this period\n<u>Stage 2: The beginnings of attachment</u>\nAround 4 months, prefer humans to inanimate objects, can distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar yet dont yet display stranger anxiety\n<u>Stage 3: Discriminate attachment</u>\nAround 7 months, start displaying separation anxiety when certain people put them down and display joy at the reunion with a certain individual, a primary attachment figure, also starts to display stranger anxiety, attach to those who respond quickly the the infants distress signals not necessarily based on time spent with infant, 65% soley mothers, 30% mothers joint attachment, 3% were soley fathers\n<u>Stage 4: Multiple attachments</u>\nSoon after main attachment formed, wide variety of attachments form, within 6 months of forming initial attachment 78% of infants formed multiple other attachments with grandparents, siblings and others (Schaffer and Emerson)\n<b><u>Schaffer and Emerson</u></b>\nMethod: 60 infants from working class homes in Glasgow, studied from 5 weeks till they were 1 year old, Mothers were visited every 4 weeks and they reported their infants response to separation in the last 7 days, described the intensity and also was asked about stranger anxiety\nResults: Found that as the infants grew older, so did their stranger and separation anxiety","<b><u>Animal studies of attachment</u></b>\n<b>Lorenz</b>\nAim: to test the effects of imprinting\nMethod: Took gosling eggs and separated them into two groups, one left with their natural mother and other group in incubator, incubated eggs first thing they saw was Lorenz and they promptly started following him round, then marked the two groups so he could dinstinguish between the goslings\nResults: Put the two groups together and they separated and started following their appropritate mother figure, Lorenzs group showed no recognition of their birth mother, found that imprinting must occur in a critical period, if an animal is not exposed to a moving object during this period they will not imprint, Lorenz also noted that it affected the goslings mating preferences, sexual imprinting, also an irreversible process\n<b>Harlow</b>\nAim: To test whether food plays a role in forming attachments\nMethod: Harlow created two wire monkeys, one with food and one with cloth for comfort, 8 Rhesus monkeys studied for period of 165 days, for four of the monkeys, the milk bottle was attached to the cloth monkey and then on the plain mother for the other 4 monkeys, also made observations of what the monkeys did when they were scared by a mechanical teddy bear\nResults: all 8 monkeys spent most of their time with the cloth monkey, whether or not they had the feeding bottle, the 4 whose milk bottles were on the plain mother spent time on the cloth mother and moved over just for food, when frightened they all went to the cloth mother, when playing with new toys they kept one foot on the cloth mother, for reassurance, show that its not food but contact comfort, resulted in the monkeys being both socially and sexually abnormal, having wire mother for over 6 months meant the monkeys were unable to recover, if under 3 months they could recover","<b><u>Explanations of attachment: Learning Theory</u></b>\nProposes all behaviour is learned rather than innate, behaviourist approach, suggesting all behaviour is a result of conditioning\n<b>Classical Conditioning</b>\nFirst investigated by Pavlov, begins with innate stimulus-response. In terms of attachment this uconditioned stimulus (UCS) is food which produce the unconditioned response (UCR) of pleasure. The mother is the neutral stimulus (NS) since she is present when the infant is being fed but currently has no association to the food in the infants eyes. Over time any NS will take on the properties of the UCS and produce the same response, so the NS now becomes a conditioned stimulus (CS) and produces a conditioned response (CR). Learning theorists called this newly formed stimulus-response 'motherly love'\n<b>Operant Conditioning</b>\nFirst researched by Skinner, offers an explanation for attachment based on operant conditioning and drive reduction theory. When the infant is hungry, there is a 'drive' to reduce the accompanying discomfort. When the infant is fed, this produces a feeling of pleasure, this is negative reinforcement. The behaviour that led to food is repeated when hungry again since it was rewarding. Food becomes primary reinforcer since it supplies the reward. Through classical conditioning the person who supplies the food is associated with the reward and hence becomes a secondary reinforcer, leads to attachment as child seeks person who can provide the reward\n<b>Social learning theory</b>\nFirst researched by Bandura, its suggested that modelling could be used to explain attachment behaviour, imitates parents affectionate behaviour, parents also directly instruct their children on how to act in relationships and reward appropriate attachment behaviours such as hugging","<b><u>Explanations of attachment: Bowlbys Theory</u></b>\n<b>ASCMI</b>\n<b>Adaptive:</b> attachments is evolutionary, used to keep us safe as infants\n<b>Social Releasers:</b> acts such as smiling and crying that mean that parents want to care for them, explains how attachments are formed\n<b>Critical Period:</b> attachments must form between 3-6 months, if no attachment formed in this period then infants will have difficulty forming attachments in later life, Bowlby proposed attachment are formed by sensitivity\n<b>Monotropy:</b> Bowlby proposed that infants have one special emotional bond, often mother, also important for secondary attachments to be formed for social and psychological development\n<b>Internal Working Model:</b> The consequences of attachment, 1) gives the child insight into caregivers behaviour and allows them to influence the caregivers behaviour to form true partnership, 2) acts as template for all future relationships to be based on", "<b><u>Ainsworths Strange Situation</u></b>\n<b>Method:</b> eight episodes to measure the behaviours of: <li>separation anxiety</li><li>reunion behaviour</li><li>stranger anxiety</li><li>parents as a secure base</li>Data collected by observers behind a one way mirror, ranked each of desired behaviours on scale\n<b>Results:</b>106 total infants, similar behaviours were exploratory behaviours reducing past epiode 2 and crying increasing\n<li><b>Secure attachment - type B:</b> 66% of infants - harmonious interactions with their caregiver, not likely to cry if caregiver leave, easily soothed by bodily contact with caregiver, showed some stranger anxiety, ued caregiver as secure base effectively and allowed for independent exploratory behaviour</li><li><b>Insecure-avoidant - type A:</b> 22% - children who tended to avoid social interaction and intimacy, showed little response to separation and didnt seek proximity of caregiver on reunion, not clingy, able to explore without presence of caregiver</li><li><b>Insecure-resistant - type C:</b> 12% - both seeks and resists intimacy, distressed when separated with caregiver, high stranger anxiety, conflicting behaviours with reunion behaviour, may angrily resist being picked up whilst maintaining close proximity</li>"]
